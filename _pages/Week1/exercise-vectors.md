  instructions: "Fill in the function <code>vectorBetween</code>, which takes in two <code>glMatrix.vec3</code> objects and which turns a <code>glMatrix.vec3</code> object representing the vector from the first vector to the second vector.  Please refer to <a href = \"http://glmatrix.net/docs/module-vec3.html\">the documentation</a> to see which functions might be useful."
  goals:
    - To use the glMatrix library and reference its API
    - To implement vector operations in code
