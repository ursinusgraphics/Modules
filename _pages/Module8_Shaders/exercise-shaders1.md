If you haven't already, please <a href = "https://github.com/Ursinus-CS476-F2020/Assignment3_Shaders/archive/master.zip">click here</a> to download the starter code for assignment 3, which also includes code for this module, the next module, and in-class exercises this week.  For this exercise, please modify the buffers in <code>triangle.js</code> so that when you run <code>triangle.html</code>, it draws an equilateral triangle with yellow in the lower left, cyan in the lower right, and magenta at the top, as shown below

<p>
  Recall that cyan is rgb(0, 1, 1), magenta is rgb(1, 0, 1), and yellow is rgb(1, 1, 0).  Recall also that the height of an equilateral triangle whose base is length 1 along the x-axis is sqrt(3)/2.
