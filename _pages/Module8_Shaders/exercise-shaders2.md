<p>
For this exercise, please modify the fragment shader <code>square.frag</code> so that when you run <code>square.html</code>, it draws a red square that moves from the center towards the lower right of the image.  You should use the uniform <code>uHalfSideLen</code> as half of the square length to size the square, and you should use the uniform <code>uTime</code> to create the offset that moves the square over time.  More hints are in the comments.  A correctly working implementation should look something like this
