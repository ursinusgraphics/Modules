If you haven't already, please <a href = "https://github.com/Ursinus-CS476-F2020/Assignment3_Shaders/archive/master.zip">click here</a> to download the starter code for assignment 3, which also includes code for this module, the next module, and in-class exercises this week.  For this exercise, please modify the <code>circle.frag</code> shader so that it draws a blobby red circle instead of a circle with sharp, jagged edges.  Recall that the formula for a Gaussian blob is 
</p>

<h2>
\[ e^{-\frac{(x-c_x)^2 + (y-c_y)^2}{r^2}} \]
</h2>

<p>
And that the built-in method for raising <b>e</b> to the power of something in GLSL is <code>exp</code>
</p>
