# tidyselect 1.1.2

* Fix for CRAN checks.

* Better compatibility with rlang 1.0.0 errors. More to come soon.


# tidyselect 1.1.1

* Fix for CRAN checks.

* tidyselect has been re-licensed as MIT (#217).


# tidyselect 1.1.0

* Predicate functions must now be wrapped with `where()`.

  ```{r}
  iris %>% select(where(is.factor))
  ```

  We made this change to avoid puzzling error messages when a variable
  is unexpectedly missing from the data frame and there is a
  corresponding function in the environment:

  ```{r}
  # Attempts to invoke `data()` function
  data.frame(x = 1) %>% select(data)
  ```

  Now tidyselect will correctly complain about a missing variable
  rather than trying to invoke a function.

  For compatibility we will support predicate functions starting with
  `is` for 1 version.

* `eval_select()` gains an `allow_rename` argument. If set to `FALSE`,
  renaming variables with the `c(foo = bar)` syntax is an error.
  This is useful to implement purely selective behaviour (#178).

* Fixed issue preventing repeated deprecation messages when
  `tidyselect_verbosity` is set to `"verbose"` (#184).

* `any_of()` now preserves the order of the input variables (#186).

* The return value of `eval_select()` is now always named, even when
  inputs are constant (#173).


# tidyselect 1.0.0

This is the 1.0.0 release of tidyselect. It features a more solidly
defined and implemented syntax, support for predicate functions, new
boolean operators, and much more.


## Documentation

* New Get started vignette for client packages. Read it with
  `vignette("tidyselect")` or at
  <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/tidyselect.html>.

* The definition of the tidyselect language has been consolidated. A
  technical description is now available:
  <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html>.


## Breaking changes

* Selecting non-column variables with bare names now triggers an
  informative message suggesting to use `all_of()` instead. Referring
  to contextual objects with a bare name is brittle because it might
  be masked by a data frame column. Using `all_of()` is safe (#76).

tidyselect now uses vctrs for validating inputs. These changes may
reveal programming errors that were previously silent. They may also
cause failures if your unit tests make faulty assumptions about the
content of error messages created in tidyselect:

* Out-of-bounds errors are thrown when a name doesn't exist or a
  location is too large for the input.

* Logical vectors now fail properly.

* Selected variables now must be unique. It was previously possible to
  return duplicate selections in some circumstances.

* The input names can no longer contain `NA` values.

Note that we recommend `testthat::verify_output()` for monitoring
error messages thrown from packages that you don't control. Unlike
`expect_error()`, `verify_output()` does not cause CMD check failures
when error messages have changed. See
<https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/11/testthat-2-3-0/> for more
information.


## Syntax

* The boolean operators can now be used to create selections (#106).

  - `!` negates a selection.
  - `|` takes the union of two selections.
  - `&` takes the intersection of two selections.

  These patterns can currently be achieved using `-`, `c()` and
  `intersect()` respectively. The boolean operators should be more
  intuitive to use.

  Many thanks to Irene Steves (@isteves) for suggesting this UI.

* You can now use predicate functions in selection contexts:

  ```r
  iris %>% select(is.factor)
  iris %>% select(is.factor | is.numeric)
  ```

  This feature is not available in functions that use the legacy
  interface of tidyselect. These need to be updated to use
  the new `eval_select()` function instead of `vars_select()`.

* Unary `-` inside nested `c()` is now consistently syntax for set
  difference (#130).

* Improved support for named elements. It is now possible to assign
  the same name to multiple elements, if the input data structure
  doesn't require unique names (i.e. anything but a data frame).

* The selection engine has been rewritten to support a clearer
  separation between data-expressions (calls to `:`, `-`, and `c`) and
  env-expressions (anything else). This means you can now safely use
  expressions of the type:

  ```r
  data %>% select(1:ncol(data))
  data %>% pivot_longer(1:ncol(data))
  ```

  Even if the data frame `data` contains a column also named `data`,
  the subexpression `ncol(data)` is still correctly evaluated.
  The `data:ncol(data)` expression is equivalent to `2:3` because
  `data` is looked up in the relevant context without ambiguity:

  ```r
  data <- tibble(foo = 1, data = 2, bar = 3)
  data %>% dplyr::select(data:ncol(data))
  #> # A tibble: 1 x 2
  #>    data   bar
  #>   <dbl> <dbl>
  #> 1     2     3
  ```

  While this example above is a bit contrived, there are many realistic
  cases where these changes make it easier to write safe code:

  ```{r}
  select_from <- function(data, var) {
    data %>% dplyr::select({{ var }} : ncol(data))
  }
  data %>% select_from(data)
  #> # A tibble: 1 x 2
  #>    data   bar
  #>   <dbl> <dbl>
  #> 1     2     3
  ```


## User-facing improvements

* The new selection helpers `all_of()` and `any_of()` are strict
  variants of `one_of()`. The former always fails if some variables
  are unknown, while the latter does not. `all_of()` is safer to use
  when you expect all selected variables to exist. `any_of()` is
  useful in other cases, for instance to ensure variables are selected
  out:

  ```
  vars <- c("Species", "Genus")
  iris %>% dplyr::select(-any_of(vars))
  ```

  Note that `all_of()` and `any_of()` are a bit more conservative in
  their function signature than `one_of()`: they do not accept dots.
  The equivalent of `one_of("a", "b")` is `all_of(c("a", "b"))`.

* Selection helpers like `all_of()` and `starts_with()` are now
  available in all selection contexts, even when they haven't been
  attached to the search path. The most visible consequence of this
  change is that it is now easier to use selection functions without
  attaching the host package:

  ```r
  # Before
  dplyr::select(mtcars, dplyr::starts_with("c"))

  # After
  dplyr::select(mtcars, starts_with("c"))
  ```

  It is still recommended to export the helpers from your package so
  that users can easily look up the documentation with `?`.

* `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, and `matches()` now
  accept vector inputs (#50). For instance these are now equivalent
  ways of selecting all variables that start with either `"a"` or `"b"`:

  ```{r}
  starts_with(c("a", "b"))
  starts_with("a") | starts_with("b")
  ```

* `matches()` has new argument `perl` to allow for Perl-like regular
  expressions (@fmichonneau, #71)

* Better support for selecting with S3 vectors. For instance, factors
  are treated as characters.


## API

New `eval_select()` and `eval_rename()` functions for client
packages. These replace `vars_select()` and `vars_rename()`, which are
now deprecated. These functions:

* Take the full data rather than just names. This makes it possible to
  use function predicates in selection context.

* Return a numeric vector of locations rather than a vector of
  names. This makes it possible to use tidyselect with inputs that
  support duplicate names, like regular vectors.


## Other features and fixes

* The `.strict` argument of `vars_select()` now works more robustly
  and consistently.

* Using arithmetic operators in selection context now fails more
  informatively (#84).

* It is now possible to select columns in data frames containing
  duplicate variables (#94). However, the duplicates can't be part of
  the final selection.

* `eval_rename()` no longer ignore the names of unquoted character
  vectors of length 1 (#79).

* `eval_rename()` now fails when a variable is renamed to an existing
  name (#70).

* `eval_rename()` has better support for existing duplicates (but
  creating new duplicates is an error).

* `eval_select()`, `eval_rename()` and `vars_pull()` now detect
  missing values uniformly (#72).

* `vars_pull()` now includes the faulty expression in error messages.

* The performance issues of `eval_rename()` with many arguments have
  been fixed. This make `dplyr::rename_all()` with many columns much
  faster (@zkamvar, #92).

* tidyselect is now much faster with many columns, thanks to a
  performance fix in `rlang::env_bind()` as well as internal fixes.

* `vars_select()` ignores vectors with only zeros (#82).


# tidyselect 0.2.5

This is a maintenance release for compatibility with rlang 0.3.0.


# tidyselect 0.2.4

* Fixed a warning that occurred when a vector of column positions was
  supplied to `vars_select()` or functions depending on it such as
  `tidyr::gather()` (#43 and tidyverse/tidyr#374).

* Fixed compatibility issue with rlang 0.2.0 (#51).


# tidyselect 0.2.3

* Internal fixes in prevision of using `tidyselect` within `dplyr`.

* `vars_select()` and `vars_rename()` now correctly support unquoting
  character vectors that have names.

* `vars_select()` now ignores missing variables.


# tidyselect 0.2.2

* `dplyr` is now correctly mentioned as suggested package.


# tidyselect 0.2.1

* `-` now supports character vectors in addition to strings. This
  makes it easy to unquote column names to exclude from the set:

  ```{r}
  vars <- c("cyl", "am", "disp", "drat")
  vars_select(names(mtcars), - !!vars)
  ```

* `last_col()` now issues an error when the variable vector is empty.

* `last_col()` now returns column positions rather than column names
  for consistency with other helpers. This also makes it compatible
  with functions like `seq()`.

* `c()` now supports character vectors the same way as `-` and `seq()`.
  (#37 @gergness)


# tidyselect 0.2.0

The main point of this release is to revert a troublesome behaviour
introduced in tidyselect 0.1.0. It also includes a few features.


## Evaluation rules

The special evaluation semantics for selection have been changed
back to the old behaviour because the new rules were causing too
much trouble and confusion. From now on data expressions (symbols
and calls to `:` and `c()`) can refer to both registered variables
and to objects from the context.

However the semantics for context expressions (any calls other than
to `:` and `c()`) remain the same. Those expressions are evaluated
in the context only and cannot refer to registered variables.

If you're writing functions and refer to contextual objects, it is
still a good idea to avoid data expressions. Since registered
variables are change as a function of user input and you never know
if your local objects might be shadowed by a variable. Consider:

```
n <- 2
vars_select(letters, 1:n)
```

Should that select up to the second element of `letters` or up to
the 14th? Since the variables have precedence in a data expression,
this will select the 14 first letters. This can be made more robust
by turning the data expression into a context expression:

```
vars_select(letters, seq(1, n))
```

You can also use quasiquotation since unquoted arguments are
guaranteed to be evaluated without any user data in scope. While
equivalent because of the special rules for context expressions,
this may be clearer to the reader accustomed to tidy eval:

```{r}
vars_select(letters, seq(1, !! n))
```

Finally, you may want to be more explicit in the opposite direction.
If you expect a variable to be found in the data but not in the
context, you can use the `.data` pronoun:

```{r}
vars_select(names(mtcars), .data$cyl : .data$drat)
```

## New features

* The new select helper `last_col()` is helpful to select over a
  custom range: `vars_select(vars, 3:last_col())`.

* `:` and `-` now handle strings as well. This makes it easy to
  unquote a column name: `(!!name) : last_col()` or `- !!name`.

* `vars_select()` gains a `.strict` argument similar to
  `rename_vars()`.  If set to `FALSE`, errors about unknown variables
  are ignored.

* `vars_select()` now treats `NULL` as empty inputs. This follows a
  trend in the tidyverse tools.

* `vars_rename()` now handles variable positions (integers or round
  doubles) just like `vars_select()` (#20).

* `vars_rename()` is now implemented with the tidy eval framework.
  Like `vars_select()`, expressions are evaluated without any user
  data in scope. In addition a variable context is now established so
  you can write rename helpers. Those should return a single round
  number or a string (variable position or variable name).

* `has_vars()` is a predicate that tests whether a variable context
  has been set (#21).

* The selection helpers are now exported in a list
  `vars_select_helpers`.  This is intended for APIs that embed the
  helpers in the evaluation environment.


## Fixes

* `one_of()` argument `vars` has been renamed to `.vars` to avoid
  spurious matching.


# tidyselect 0.1.1

tidyselect is the new home for the legacy functions
`dplyr::select_vars()`, `dplyr::rename_vars()` and
`dplyr::select_var()`.


## API changes

We took this opportunity to make a few changes to the API:

* `select_vars()` and `rename_vars()` are now `vars_select()` and
  `vars_rename()`. This follows the tidyverse convention that a prefix
  corresponds to the input type while suffixes indicate the output
  type. Similarly, `select_var()` is now `vars_pull()`.

* The arguments are now prefixed with dots to limit argument matching
  issues. While the dots help, it is still a good idea to splice a
  list of captured quosures to make sure dotted arguments are never
  matched to `vars_select()`'s named arguments:

  ```
  vars_select(vars, !!! quos(...))
  ```

* Error messages can now be customised. For consistency with dplyr,
  error messages refer to "columns" by default. This assumes that the
  variables being selected come from a data frame. If this is not
  appropriate for your DSL, you can now add an attribute `vars_type`
  to the `.vars` vector to specify alternative names. This must be a
  character vector of length 2 whose first component is the singular
  form and the second is the plural. For example, `c("variable",
  "variables")`.


## Establishing a variable context

tidyselect provides a few more ways of establishing a variable
context:

* `scoped_vars()` sets up a variable context along with an an exit
  hook that automatically restores the previous variables. It is the
  preferred way of changing the variable context.

  `with_vars()` takes variables and an expression and evaluates the
  latter in the context of the former.

* `poke_vars()` establishes a new variable context. It returns the
  previous context invisibly and it is your responsibility to restore
  it after you are done. This is for expert use only.

  `current_vars()` has been renamed to `peek_vars()`. This naming is a
  reference to [peek and poke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE)
  from legacy languages.


## New evaluation semantics

The evaluation semantics for selecting verbs have changed. Symbols are
now evaluated in a data-only context that is isolated from the calling
environment. This means that you can no longer refer to local variables
unless you are explicitly unquoting these variables with `!!`, which
is mostly for expert use.

Note that since dplyr 0.7, helper calls (like `starts_with()`) obey
the opposite behaviour and are evaluated in the calling context
isolated from the data context. To sum up, symbols can only refer to
data frame objects, while helpers can only refer to contextual
objects. This differs from usual R evaluation semantics where both
the data and the calling environment are in scope (with the former
prevailing over the latter).

<p>To illustrate the semantics of tidyselect, weâ€™ll use variants of <code>dplyr::select()</code> and <code>dplyr::rename()</code> that return the named vector of locations for the selected or renamed elements:</p>

<div id="sets-of-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Sets of variables</h2>
<p>The tidyselect syntax is all about <strong>sets</strong> of variables, internally represented by integer vectors of <strong>locations</strong>. For example, <code>c(1L, 2L)</code> represents the set of the first and second variables, as does <code>c(1L, 2L, 1L)</code>.</p>
<p>If a vector of locations contains duplicates, they are normally treated as the same element, since they represent sets. An exception to this occurs with named elements whose names differ. If the names donâ€™t match, they are treated as different elements in order to allow renaming a variable to multiple names (see section on Renaming variables).</p>
<p>The syntax of tidyselect is generally designed for set combination. For instance, <code>c(foo(), bar())</code> represents the union of the variables in <code>foo()</code> and those in <code>bar()</code>.</p>
<div id="bare-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Bare names</h3>
<p>Within <em>data-expressions</em> (see Evaluation section), bare names represent their own locations, i.e.Â a set of size 1. The following expressions are equivalent:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(mpg<span class="sc">:</span>hp, <span class="sc">-</span>cyl, vs)</span>

<div id="the-operator" class="section level3">
<h3>The <code>:</code> operator</h3>
<p><code>:</code> can be used to select consecutive variables between two locations. It returns the corresponding sequence of locations.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(<span class="dv">2</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">4</span>)</span>

<p>Because bare names represent their own locations, it is easy to select a range of variables:</p>

<div id="boolean-operators" class="section level3">
<h3>Boolean operators</h3>
<p>Boolean operators provide a more intuitive approach to set combination. Though sets are internally represented with vectors of locations, they could equally be represented with a full logical vector of inclusion indicators (taking the <code>which()</code> of this vector would then recover the locations). The boolean operators should be considered in terms of the logical representation of sets.</p>
<p>The <code>|</code> operator takes the <strong>union</strong> of two sets:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>iris <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(<span class="fu">starts_with</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Sepal&quot;</span>) <span class="sc">|</span> <span class="fu">ends_with</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Width&quot;</span>))</span>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator takes the <strong>intersection</strong> of two sets:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>iris <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(<span class="fu">starts_with</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Sepal&quot;</span>) <span class="sc">&amp;</span> <span class="fu">ends_with</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Width&quot;</span>))</span>

<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;           2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>!</code> operator takes the <strong>complement</strong> of a set:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>iris <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(<span class="sc">!</span><span class="fu">ends_with</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Width&quot;</span>))</span>

<p>Taking the intersection with a complement produces a set <strong>difference</strong>:</p>

<h3>Dots, <code>c()</code>, and unary <code>-</code></h3>
<p>tidyselect functions can take dots like <code>dplyr::select()</code>, or a named argument like <code>tidyr::pivot_longer()</code>.

<h4>Set combination with named variables</h4>
<p>Named elements have special rules to determine their identities in a set. Unnamed elements match any names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a | c(foo = a)</code> is equivalent to <code>c(foo = a)</code>.</li>
<li><code>a &amp; c(foo = a)</code> is equivalent to <code>c(foo = a)</code>.</li>

<p>Named elements with different names are distinct:</p>

<li><code>c(foo = a) | c(bar = a)</code> is equivalent to <code>c(foo = a, bar = a)</code>.</li>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Data-expressions and env-expressions</h3>
<p>tidyselect is not a typical tidy evaluation UI. The main difference is that there is no data masking. In a typical tidy eval function, expressions are evaluated with data-vars first in scope, followed by env-vars:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mask <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(data, expr) {</span>

<p>It is possible to bypass the data frame variables by forcing symbols to be looked up in the environment with <code>!!</code> or <code>.env</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">mask</span>(<span class="sc">!!</span>cyl <span class="sc">*</span> foo)</span>

<p>With tidyselect, there is no such hierarchical data masking. Instead, expressions are evaluated either in the context of the data frame or in the user environment, without overlap. The scope of lookup depends on the kind of expression:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>data-expressions</strong> are evaluated in the data frame only. This includes bare symbols, the boolean operators, <code>-</code>, <code>:</code>, and <code>c()</code>. You canâ€™t refer to environment-variables in a data-expression:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cyl_pos <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">2</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"><a href="#cb28-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(mpg <span class="sc">|</span> cyl_pos)</span>
<span id="cb28-3"><a href="#cb28-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; Error in `stop_subscript()`:</span></span>
<span id="cb28-4"><a href="#cb28-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; ! Can&#39;t subset columns that don&#39;t exist.</span></span>
<span id="cb28-5"><a href="#cb28-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; âœ– Column `cyl_pos` doesn&#39;t exist.</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>env-expressions</strong> are evaluated in the environment. This includes all calls other than those mentioned above, as well as symbols that are part of those calls. You canâ€™t refer to data-variables in a data-expression:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select_loc</span>(<span class="fu">all_of</span>(mpg))</span>

</ol>
<p>Because the scoping is unambiguous, you can safely refer to env-vars in an env-expression, without having to worry about potential naming clashes with data-vars:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">data.frame</span>(<span class="at">x =</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="at">y =</span> <span class="dv">4</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">6</span>, <span class="at">z =</span> <span class="dv">7</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">9</span>)</span>

<p>If you have variable names in a character vector, it is safe to refer to the env-var containing the names with <code>all_of()</code> because it is an env-expression:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1"><a href="#cb31-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>y <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;y&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;z&quot;</span>)</span>

<p>Note that currently, env-vars are still allowed in some data-expressions, for compatibility. However this is in the process of being deprecated and you should see a note recommending to use <code>all_of()</code> instead. This note will become a deprecation warning in the future, and then an error.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The tidyselect syntax was inspired by the <code>base::subset()</code> function written by Peter Dalgaard. The <code>select</code> parameter of <code>subset.data.frame()</code> is evaluated in a data mask where the column names are bound to their locations in the data frame. This allows <code>:</code> to create sequences of variable locations. The locations can be combined with <code>c()</code>. This selection interface set the tone for the development of the tidyselect syntax.</p>

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
options(
  tibble.print_min = 4,
  tibble.print_max = 4
)
options(
  crayon.enabled = FALSE
)
```

This is a technical description of the tidyselect syntax.

```{r setup}
library(tidyselect)
library(magrittr)

# For better printing
mtcars <- tibble::as_tibble(mtcars)
iris <- tibble::as_tibble(iris)
```

To illustrate the semantics of tidyselect, we'll use variants of
`dplyr::select()` and `dplyr::rename()` that return the named vector
of locations for the selected or renamed elements:

```{r}
select_loc <- function(data, ...) {
  eval_select(rlang::expr(c(...)), data)
}

rename_loc <- function(data, ...) {
  eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(...)), data)
}
```


## Sets of variables

The tidyselect syntax is all about __sets__ of variables, internally
represented by integer vectors of __locations__. For example, `c(1L,
2L)` represents the set of the first and second variables, as does
`c(1L, 2L, 1L)`.

If a vector of locations contains duplicates, they are normally
treated as the same element, since they represent sets. An exception to
this occurs with named elements whose names differ. If the names don't
match, they are treated as different elements in order to allow
renaming a variable to multiple names (see section on Renaming
variables).

The syntax of tidyselect is generally designed for set combination.
For instance, `c(foo(), bar())` represents the union of the variables
in `foo()` and those in `bar()`.


### Bare names

Within _data-expressions_ (see Evaluation section), bare names
represent their own locations, i.e. a set of size 1. The following
expressions are equivalent:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(mpg:hp, -cyl, vs)

mtcars %>% select_loc(1:4, -2, 8)
```


### The `:` operator

`:` can be used to select consecutive variables between two locations.
It returns the corresponding sequence of locations.

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(2:4)
```

Because bare names represent their own locations, it is easy to select
a range of variables:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(cyl:hp)
```


### Boolean operators

Boolean operators provide a more intuitive approach to set
combination. Though sets are internally represented with vectors of
locations, they could equally be represented with a full logical
vector of inclusion indicators (taking the `which()` of this vector
would then recover the locations). The boolean operators should be
considered in terms of the logical representation of sets.

The `|` operator takes the __union__ of two sets:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal") | ends_with("Width"))
```

The `&` operator takes the __intersection__ of two sets:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal") & ends_with("Width"))
```

The `!` operator takes the __complement__ of a set:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(!ends_with("Width"))
```

Taking the intersection with a complement produces a set
__difference__:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal") & !ends_with("Width"))
```


### Dots, `c()`, and unary `-`

tidyselect functions can take dots like `dplyr::select()`, or a named
argument like `tidyr::pivot_longer()`. In the latter case, the dots
syntax is accessible via `c()`. In fact `...` syntax is implemented
through `c(...)` and is thus completely equivalent.

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(mpg, disp:hp)

mtcars %>% select_loc(c(mpg, disp:hp))
```

Dots and `c()` are syntax for:

* Set union or set difference
* Renaming variables

Non-negative inputs are recursively joined with `union()`. The
precedence is left-associative, just like with boolean operators.
These expressions are all syntax for _set union_:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal"), ends_with("Width"), Species)

iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal") | ends_with("Width") | Species)

iris %>% select_loc(union(union(starts_with("Sepal"), ends_with("Width")), 5L))
```

Unary `-` is normally syntax for _set difference_:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal"), -ends_with("Width"), -Sepal.Length)

iris %>% select_loc(setdiff(setdiff(starts_with("Sepal"), ends_with("Width")), 1L))
```

If the first `...` or `c()` input is negative, an implicit
`everything()` is appended.

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(-starts_with("Sepal"))

iris %>% select_loc(everything(), -starts_with("Sepal"))

iris %>% select_loc(setdiff(everything(), starts_with("Sepal")))
```

In this case, unary `-` is syntax for _set complement_. Unary `-` and
`!` are equivalent:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(-starts_with("Sepal"))

iris %>% select_loc(!starts_with("Sepal"))
```

Each level of `c()` is independent. In particular, a nested `c()`
starting with `-` always stands for set complement:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(c(starts_with("Sepal"), -Sepal.Length))

iris %>% select_loc(c(starts_with("Sepal"), c(-Sepal.Length)))
```

In boolean terms, these expressions are equivalent to:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal") & !Sepal.Length)

iris %>% select_loc(starts_with("Sepal") | !Sepal.Length)
```

In general, when unary `-` is used alone outside `...` or `c()`, it
stands for set complement.


### Renaming variables

#### Name combination and propagation

When named inputs are provided in `...` or `c()`, the selection is
renamed. If the inputs are already named, the outer and inner names
are __combined__ with a `...` separator:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(foo = c(bar = mpg, baz = cyl))
```

Otherwise the outer names is __propagated__ to the selected elements
according to the following rules:

- With data frames, a numeric suffix is appended because columns
  must be uniquely named.

    ```{r}
    mtcars %>% select_loc(foo = c(mpg, cyl))
    ```

- With normal vectors, the name is simply assigned to all selected
  inputs.

    ```{r}
    as.list(mtcars) %>% select_loc(foo = c(mpg, cyl))
    ```

Combination and propagation can be composed by using nested `c()`:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(foo = c(bar = c(mpg, cyl)))
```


#### Set combination with named variables

Named elements have special rules to determine their identities in a
set. Unnamed elements match any names:

- `a | c(foo = a)` is equivalent to `c(foo = a)`.
- `a & c(foo = a)` is equivalent to `c(foo = a)`.

Named elements with different names are distinct:

- `c(foo = a) & c(bar = a)` is equivalent to `c()`.
- `c(foo = a) | c(bar = a)` is equivalent to `c(foo = a, bar = a)`.

Because unnamed elements match any named ones, it is possible to
select multiple elements and rename one of them:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(!Species, foo = Sepal.Width)
```


### Predicate functions

Predicate function objects can be supplied as input in an
env-expression, typically with the selection helper `where()`. They
are applied to all elements of the data, and should return `TRUE` or
`FALSE` to indicate inclusion. Predicates in env-expressions are
effectively expanded to the set of variables that they represent:

```{r}
iris %>% select_loc(where(is.numeric))

iris %>% select_loc(where(is.factor))

iris %>% select_loc(where(is.numeric) | where(is.factor))

iris %>% select_loc(where(is.numeric) & where(is.factor))
```


## Selection helpers

We call _selection helpers_ any function that inspects the currently
active variables with `peek_vars()` and returns a selection.

- `peek_vars()` returns a character vector of names.
- The returned selection can be any output conforming to the types
  described in the Data types section.

Examples of selection helpers are `all_of()`, `contains()`, or
`last_col()`. These selection helpers are evaluated as env-expressions
(see Evaluation section).


## Supported data types

The following data types can be returned from selection helpers or
forced via `!!` or `force()` (the latter works in tidyselect because
it is treated as an env-expression, see Evaluation section):

- Vectors of locations:

    ```{r}
    iris %>% select_loc(force(c(1, 3)))
    ```

- Vectors of names. These are matched and transformed to locations.

    ```{r}
    iris %>% select_loc(force(c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Length")))
    ```

- Predicate functions. These are applied to all elements to determine
  inclusion.

    ```{r}
    iris %>% select_loc(force(is.numeric))
    ```


## Evaluation

### Data-expressions and env-expressions

tidyselect is not a typical tidy evaluation UI. The main difference is
that there is no data masking. In a typical tidy eval function,
expressions are evaluated with data-vars first in scope, followed by
env-vars:

```{r}
mask <- function(data, expr) {
  rlang::eval_tidy(rlang::enquo(expr), data)
}

foo <- 10
cyl <- 200

# `cyl` represents the data frame column here:
mtcars %>% mask(cyl * foo)
```

It is possible to bypass the data frame variables by forcing symbols
to be looked up in the environment with `!!` or `.env`:

```{r}
mtcars %>% mask(!!cyl * foo)
mtcars %>% mask(.env$cyl * foo)
```

With tidyselect, there is no such hierarchical data masking. Instead,
expressions are evaluated either in the context of the data frame or
in the user environment, without overlap. The scope of lookup depends
on the kind of expression:

1.  __data-expressions__ are evaluated in the data frame only. This
    includes bare symbols, the boolean operators, `-`, `:`, and `c()`.
    You can't refer to environment-variables in a data-expression:

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    cyl_pos <- 2
    mtcars %>% select_loc(mpg | cyl_pos)
    ```

2.  __env-expressions__ are evaluated in the environment. This
    includes all calls other than those mentioned above, as well as
    symbols that are part of those calls. You can't refer to
    data-variables in a data-expression:

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    mtcars %>% select_loc(all_of(mpg))
    ```

Because the scoping is unambiguous, you can safely refer to env-vars
in an env-expression, without having to worry about potential naming
clashes with data-vars:

```{r}
x <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6, z = 7:9)

# `ncol(x)` is an env-expression, so `x` represents the data frame in
# the environment rather than the column in the data frame
x %>% select_loc(2:ncol(x))
```

If you have variable names in a character vector, it is safe to refer
to the env-var containing the names with `all_of()` because it is an
env-expression:

```{r}
y <- c("y", "z")
x %>% select_loc(all_of(y))
```

Note that currently, env-vars are still allowed in some
data-expressions, for compatibility. However this is in the process of
being deprecated and you should see a note recommending to use
`all_of()` instead. This note will become a deprecation warning in the
future, and then an error.

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(cyl_pos)
```


### Arithmetic operators

Within data-expressions (see Evaluation section), `+`, `*` and `/` are
overridden to cause an error. This is to prevent confusion stemming
from normal data masking usage where variables can be transformed on
the fly:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>% select_loc(cyl^2)

mtcars %>% select_loc(mpg * wt)
```


## Selecting versus renaming

The select and rename variants take the same types of inputs and
have the same type of return value. They have a few important
differences.


### All renaming inputs must be named

Unlike `eval_select()` which can select without renaming,
`eval_rename()` expects a fully named selection. If one or several
names are missing, an error is thrown.

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>% select_loc(mpg)

mtcars %>% rename_loc(mpg)
```


### Renaming to an existing variable name

If the input data is a data frame, tidyselect generally throws an
error when duplicate column names are selected, in order to respect
the invariant of unique column names.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Lists can have duplicates
as.list(mtcars) %>% select_loc(foo = mpg, foo = cyl)

# Data frames cannot
mtcars %>% select_loc(foo = mpg, foo = cyl)
```

A selection can rename a variable to an existing name if the latter is
not part of the selection:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>% select_loc(cyl, cyl = mpg)

mtcars %>% select_loc(disp, cyl = mpg)
```

This is not possible when renaming.

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>% rename_loc(cyl, cyl = mpg)

mtcars %>% rename_loc(disp, cyl = mpg)
```

However, the name conflict can be solved by renaming the existing
variable to another name:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select_loc(foo = cyl, cyl = mpg)

mtcars %>% rename_loc(foo = cyl, cyl = mpg)
```


## Duplicate columns in data frames

Normally a data frame shouldn't have duplicate names. However, the
real world is messy and duplicates do happen in the wild. tidyselect
tries to be as permissive as it can with these duplicates so that
users can restore unique names with `select()` or `rename()`.

First let's create a data frame with duplicate names:

```{r}
dups <- vctrs::new_data_frame(list(x = 1, y = 2, x = 3))
```

If the duplicates are not part of the selection, they are simply
ignored:

```{r}
dups %>% select_loc(y)
```

If the duplicates are selected, this is an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
dups %>% select_loc(x)
```

The duplicate names can be repaired by renaming chosen locations:

```{r}
dups %>% select_loc(x, foo = 3)

dups %>% rename_loc(foo = 3)
```


## Acknowledgements

The tidyselect syntax was inspired by the `base::subset()` function
written by Peter Dalgaard. The `select` parameter of
`subset.data.frame()` is evaluated in a data mask where the column
names are bound to their locations in the data frame. This allows `:`
to create sequences of variable locations. The locations can be
combined with `c()`. This selection interface set the tone for the
development of the tidyselect syntax.

```{r}
mtcars %>% subset(select = c(cyl, hp:wt))
```

<p>tidyselect implements a specialised sublanguage of R for selecting variables from data frames and other data structures. A technical description of the DSL is available in the <a href="https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html">syntax vignette</a>.</p>
<p>In this vignette, we describe how to include tidyselect in your own packages. If you just want to know how to use tidyselect syntax in dplyr or tidyr, please read <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select" class="uri">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select</a> instead.</p>
<div id="before-we-start" class="section level2">
<h2>Before we start</h2>
<div id="selections-as-dots-or-as-named-arguments" class="section level3">
<h3>Selections as dots or as named arguments</h3>
<p>There are two major ways of designing a function that takes selections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing <strong>dots</strong> as in <code>dplyr::select()</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> dplyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">select</span>(mpg, cyl)</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Interpolating <strong>named arguments</strong> as in <code>tidyr::pivot_longer()</code>. In this case, multiple inputs can be provided inside <code>c()</code> or by using boolean operators:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">pivot_longer</span>(<span class="fu">c</span>(mpg, cyl))</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">pivot_longer</span>(mpg <span class="sc">|</span> cyl)</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>Our general recommendation is to take dots when the main purpose of the function is to create a new data structure based on a selection. When the selection is accessory to the main purpose of the function, take it as a named argument. In doubt, we recommend using named arguments because it is easier to change a named argument to dots than the other way around. For more advice about this, see the <a href="https://design.tidyverse.org/dots-data.html">Making data with <code>...</code></a> section of the tidyverse design book.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-you-need-tidyselect" class="section level3">
<h3>Do you need tidyselect?</h3>
<p>The tools described in this vignette are rather low level. Depending on your use case, it may be easier to wrap <code>dplyr::select()</code>. Youâ€™ll get a data frame containing the columns selected by your user, which you can then handle in various ways.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate how you could write a function that takes a selection of data and returns the corresponding data frame with capitalised names:</p>

<p>The main advantage of the lower level tidyselect tools is that they offer a bit more information and flexibility. Instead of returning the selected data, they return the <strong>locations</strong> of selected elements inside the input data. If you donâ€™t need the selected locations and can afford the dependency, you may consider wrapping dplyr instead.</p>

<div id="the-selection-evaluators" class="section level2">
<h2>The selection evaluators</h2>
<p>tidyselect is implemented with non-standard evaluation (NSE). This unique feature of the R language refers to the ability of functions to <strong>defuse</strong> (i.e.Â delay the execution) some or all of their arguments, and resume evaluation later on<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Crucially, evaluation can be resumed in a different context or according to different rules, which is often how domain-specific languages are created in R.</p>
<div id="defusing-and-resuming-evaluation-of-r-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Defusing and resuming evaluation of R code</h3>
<p>When a function argument is defused, R halts the evaluation of the code and returns a defused expression instead. This expression contains the code that describes how to compute the intended value.</p>
<p>Defuse <em>your own</em> R code with <code>expr()</code>:</p>

<p>You can resume the evaluation in data context by passing a data frame as <code>data</code> argument:</p>

<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Resuming evaluation in a data context is known as <strong>data masking</strong>. The data-vars inside the data frame are combined with the env-vars of the environment, making it possible for users to refer to their data variables:</p>

<p><code>eval_rename()</code> is very similar to <code>eval_select()</code> but it has more constraints because it is meant for renaming variables in place. In particular it throws an error if the selected inputs are unnamed. In practice, <code>eval_rename()</code> only accepts a <code>c()</code> expression as <code>expr</code> argument, and all inputs inside the outermost <code>c()</code> must be named:</p>

<h2>Creating selection helpers</h2>
<p>Tools like <code>starts_with()</code> or <code>contains()</code> are called <strong>selection helpers</strong>. These tools inspect the variable names currently available for selection with <code>peek_vars()</code>. The variable names are registered automatically by <code>eval_select()</code> for the duration of the evaluation:</p>

<p>Such properties temporarily available by calling a function like <code>peek_vars()</code> are called <strong>descriptors</strong>. Descriptors are useful because they are very easy to compose. For instance, a user could combine <code>starts_with()</code> and <code>ends_with()</code> without having to worry about passing the variables or the environment in which they can be found:</p>

<p>The <code>fn</code> argument makes the error message more informative when the helper is used in the wrong context:</p>

<p>Because the variables are inspected in a default argument, it is easy to override. This is mostly useful in unit tests:</p>

<div id="handling-duplicate-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Handling duplicate variables</h3>
<p>However our current implementation of <code>if_width()</code> has a design flaw. It doesnâ€™t work properly when the input has duplicate names:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb23-1"><a href="#cb23-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dups <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> vctrs<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">new_data_frame</span>(<span class="fu">list</span>(<span class="at">foo =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="at">quux =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="at">foo =</span> <span class="dv">3</span>))</span>
<span id="cb23-2"><a href="#cb23-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb23-3"><a href="#cb23-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dups <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="fu">if_width</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))</span>
<span id="cb23-4"><a href="#cb23-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   foo</span></span>
<span id="cb23-5"><a href="#cb23-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 1   1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Supporting duplicates is recommended because data frames in the wild donâ€™t always have unique names. Also, tidyselect can be used with vectors that donâ€™t require unique names, and it might be extended to allow recoding character vectors in the future. In these cases, handling duplicates is part of the normal usage for selection helpers.</p>
<p>To support duplicates it is recommended to return vectors of locations from selection helpers rather than vector of names. Fixing <code>if_width()</code> is easy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>if_width <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(n, <span class="at">vars =</span> <span class="fu">peek_vars</span>(<span class="at">fn =</span> <span class="st">&quot;if_width&quot;</span>)) {</span>
<span id="cb24-2"><a href="#cb24-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">which</span>(<span class="fu">nchar</span>(vars) <span class="sc">==</span> n)</span>
<span id="cb24-3"><a href="#cb24-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If the input is a data frame, the user is now informed that their selection should not contain duplicates:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dups <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="fu">if_width</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))</span>
<span id="cb25-2"><a href="#cb25-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; Error in `stop_vctrs()`:</span></span>
<span id="cb25-3"><a href="#cb25-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; ! Names must be unique.</span></span>
<span id="cb25-4"><a href="#cb25-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; âœ– These names are duplicated:</span></span>

<p>And all the duplicates are selected if the input is not a data frame, as expected:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">as.list</span>(dups) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="fu">if_width</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>))</span>

tidyselect implements a specialised sublanguage of R for selecting
variables from data frames and other data structures. A technical
description of the DSL is available in the [syntax
vignette](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html).

In this vignette, we describe how to include tidyselect in your own
packages. If you just want to know how to use tidyselect syntax in
dplyr or tidyr, please read <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select>
instead.


## Before we start

### Selections as dots or as named arguments

There are two major ways of designing a function that takes
selections.

- Passing __dots__ as in `dplyr::select()`.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mtcars %>% dplyr::select(mpg, cyl)
    ```

- Interpolating __named arguments__ as in `tidyr::pivot_longer()`. In
  this case, multiple inputs can be provided inside `c()` or by using
  boolean operators:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    mtcars %>% pivot_longer(c(mpg, cyl))
    mtcars %>% pivot_longer(mpg | cyl)
    ```

Our general recommendation is to take dots when the main purpose of
the function is to create a new data structure based on a selection.
When the selection is accessory to the main purpose of the function,
take it as a named argument. In doubt, we recommend using named
arguments because it is easier to change a named argument to dots than
the other way around. For more advice about this, see the [Making data
with `...`](https://design.tidyverse.org/dots-data.html) section of
the tidyverse design book.


### Do you need tidyselect?

The tools described in this vignette are rather low level. Depending
on your use case, it may be easier to wrap `dplyr::select()`. You'll
get a data frame containing the columns selected by your user, which
you can then handle in various ways.

The following examples illustrate how you could write a function that
takes a selection of data and returns the corresponding data frame
with capitalised names:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Passing dots
toupper_dots <- function(data, ...) {
  sel <- dplyr::select(data, ...)
  rlang::set_names(sel, toupper)
}
# Interpolating a named argument with {{ }}
toupper_arg <- function(data, arg) {
  sel <- dplyr::select(data, {{ arg }})
  rlang::set_names(sel, toupper)
}

mtcars %>% toupper_dots(mpg:disp, vs)
#> # A tibble: 32 x 4
#>     MPG   CYL  DISP    VS
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1  21       6   160     0
#> 2  21       6   160     0
#> 3  22.8     4   108     1
#> 4  21.4     6   258     1
#> # â€¦ with 28 more rows

mtcars %>% toupper_arg(c(mpg:disp, vs))
#> # A tibble: 32 x 4
#>     MPG   CYL  DISP    VS
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1  21       6   160     0
#> 2  21       6   160     0
#> 3  22.8     4   108     1
#> 4  21.4     6   258     1
#> # â€¦ with 28 more rows
```

The main advantage of the lower level tidyselect tools is that they
offer a bit more information and flexibility. Instead of returning the
selected data, they return the __locations__ of selected elements
inside the input data. If you don't need the selected locations and
can afford the dependency, you may consider wrapping dplyr instead.


## The selection evaluators

tidyselect is implemented with non-standard evaluation (NSE). This
unique feature of the R language refers to the ability of functions to
__defuse__ (i.e. delay the execution) some or all of their arguments,
and resume evaluation later on[^1]. Crucially, evaluation can be
resumed in a different context or according to different rules, which
is often how domain-specific languages are created in R.

[^1]: The defusing step is also known as _quoting_.

### Defusing and resuming evaluation of R code

When a function argument is defused, R halts the evaluation of the
code and returns a defused expression instead. This expression
contains the code that describes how to compute the intended value.

Defuse _your own_ R code with `expr()`:

```{r}
own <- rlang::expr(1 + 2)
own
```

Defuse _the user's_ R code with `enquo()`:

```{r}
fn <- function(arg) {
  expr <- rlang::enquo(arg)
  expr
}
user <- fn(1 + 2)
user
```

To resume the evaluation of the defused R code, use `eval_tidy()`:

```{r}
rlang::eval_tidy(own)

rlang::eval_tidy(user)
```

You can resume the evaluation in data context by passing a data frame
as `data` argument:

```{r}
with_data <- function(data, x) {
  expr <- rlang::enquo(x)
  rlang::eval_tidy(expr, data = data)
}
```

Resuming evaluation in a data context is known as __data masking__.
The data-vars inside the data frame are combined with the env-vars of
the environment, making it possible for users to refer to their data
variables:

```{r, error = TRUE}
NULL %>% with_data(mean(cyl) * 10)

mtcars %>% with_data(mean(cyl) * 10)
```


### Resuming defused R code with tidyselect rules

Taking tidyselect selections in your functions follows the same
principles. First defuse an expression, then resume its evaluation.
Instead of `eval_tidy()`, we need the special interpreters
`eval_select()` and `eval_rename()`. Like `eval_tidy()`, they take a
defused expression and some data. They return a vector of locations
for the selected elements:

```{r}
eval_select(rlang::expr(mpg), mtcars)

eval_select(rlang::expr(c(mpg:disp, vs)), mtcars)
```

If the user has renamed some of the selected elements, the names of
the vector of locations reflect the new names.

```{r}
eval_select(rlang::expr(c(foo = mpg, bar = disp)), mtcars)

eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(foo = mpg, bar = disp)), mtcars)
```

`eval_select()` is most likely the variant that you'll need to
implement your tidyselect functions.


#### Simple selections with dots

If your selecting function takes dots:

1. Pass the dots to `c()` inside a defused expression.

2. Resume evaluation of the defused `c()` expression with
   `eval_select()`.

3. Use the vector of locations returned by `eval_select()` to subset
   and rename the input data.

Here is how to reimplement `dplyr::select()` in 3 lines representing
each of the steps above:

```{r}
select <- function(.data, ...) {
  expr <- rlang::expr(c(...))
  pos <- eval_select(expr, data = .data)
  rlang::set_names(.data[pos], names(pos))
}

mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl)
```


#### Simple selections with named arguments

If your selecting function takes named arguments, the defusing step is
a bit different. We need to use `enquo()` to defuse the function
argument itself.

```{r}
select <- function(.data, cols) {
  expr <- rlang::enquo(cols)
  pos <- eval_select(expr, data = .data)
  rlang::set_names(.data[pos], names(pos))
}

mtcars %>%
  select(c(mpg, cyl))
```


#### Renaming selections

The `eval_rename()` variant is rarely needed and only mentioned here
for completeness. First note that both `eval_select()` and
`eval_rename()` allow renaming variables:

```{r}
eval_select(rlang::expr(c(foo = mpg)), mtcars)

eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(foo = mpg)), mtcars)
```

`eval_rename()` is very similar to `eval_select()` but it has more
constraints because it is meant for renaming variables in place. In
particular it throws an error if the selected inputs are unnamed. In
practice, `eval_rename()` only accepts a `c()` expression as `expr`
argument, and all inputs inside the outermost `c()` must be named:

```{r, error = TRUE}
eval_rename(rlang::expr(mpg), mtcars)

eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(mpg)), mtcars)

eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(foo = mpg)), mtcars)
```

Because of this constraint, it doesn't make much sense to take a named
argument, most of the time you'll want to pass dots to a defused `c()`
expression. This way the user can easily pass names with the
selections:

```{r}
wrapper <- function(data, ...) {
  eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(...)), data)
}

mtcars %>% wrapper(foo = mpg, bar = hp:wt)
```

As an example of how to use the vector of locations returned by
`eval_rename()`, here is how to implement `dplyr::rename()`:

```{r}
rename <- function(.data, ...) {
  pos <- eval_rename(rlang::expr(c(...)), .data)
  names(.data)[pos] <- names(pos)
  .data
}

mtcars %>%
  rename(foo = mpg, bar = hp:wt)
```


## Creating selection helpers

Tools like `starts_with()` or `contains()` are called __selection
helpers__. These tools inspect the variable names currently available
for selection with `peek_vars()`. The variable names are registered
automatically by `eval_select()` for the duration of the evaluation:

```{r}
x <- rlang::expr(print(peek_vars()))

invisible(eval_select(x, data = mtcars))
```

Such properties temporarily available by calling a function like
`peek_vars()` are called __descriptors__. Descriptors are useful
because they are very easy to compose. For instance, a user could
combine `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` without having to worry
about passing the variables or the environment in which they can be
found:

```{r}
my_selector <- function(prefix, suffix) {
  intersect(
    starts_with(prefix),
    ends_with(suffix)
  )
}

iris %>% select(my_selector("Sepal", "Length"))
```

To create a new selection helper:

1. Inspect the variables with `peek_vars()`. By convention this should
   be done in an argument that the user can override.

2. Return one of the supported data types: vector of names or
   locations (the latter is recommended, see section on handling
   duplicate variables), or a predicate function.

```{r}
if_width <- function(n, vars = peek_vars(fn = "if_width")) {
  vars[nchar(vars) == n]
}

mtcars %>% select(if_width(2))
```

The `fn` argument makes the error message more informative when the
helper is used in the wrong context:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars[if_width(2)]
```

Because the variables are inspected in a default argument, it is easy
to override. This is mostly useful in unit tests:

```{r}
if_width(2, vars = names(mtcars))
```


### Handling duplicate variables

However our current implementation of `if_width()` has a design
flaw. It doesn't work properly when the input has duplicate names:

```{r}
dups <- vctrs::new_data_frame(list(foo = 1, quux = 2, foo = 3))

dups %>% select(if_width(3))
```

Supporting duplicates is recommended because data frames in the wild
don't always have unique names. Also, tidyselect can be used with
vectors that don't require unique names, and it might be extended to
allow recoding character vectors in the future. In these cases,
handling duplicates is part of the normal usage for selection helpers.

To support duplicates it is recommended to return vectors of locations
from selection helpers rather than vector of names. Fixing `if_width()`
is easy:

```{r}
if_width <- function(n, vars = peek_vars(fn = "if_width")) {
  which(nchar(vars) == n)
}
```

If the input is a data frame, the user is now informed that their
selection should not contain duplicates:

```{r, error = TRUE}
dups %>% select(if_width(3))
```

And all the duplicates are selected if the input is not a data frame,
as expected:

```{r}
as.list(dups) %>% select(if_width(3))
```
