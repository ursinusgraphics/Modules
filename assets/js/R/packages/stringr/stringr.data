# stringr 1.4.0

* `str_interp()` now renders lists consistently independent on the presence of
  additional placeholders (@amhrasmussen).

* New `str_starts()` and `str_ends()` functions to detect patterns at the 
  beginning or end of strings (@jonthegeek, #258).

* `str_subset()`, `str_detect()`, and `str_which()` get `negate` argument,
  which is useful when you want the elements that do NOT match (#259,
  @yutannihilation).
  
* New `str_to_sentence()` function to capitalize with sentence case 
  (@jonthegeek, #202).

# stringr 1.3.1

* `str_replace_all()` with a named vector now respects modifier functions (#207)

* `str_trunc()` is once again vectorised correctly (#203, @austin3dickey).

* `str_view()` handles `NA` values more gracefully (#217). I've also
  tweaked the sizing policy so hopefully it should work better in notebooks,
  while preserving the existing behaviour in knit documents (#232).

# stringr 1.3.0

## API changes

* During package build, you may see 
  `Error : object â€˜ignore.caseâ€™ is not exported by 'namespace:stringr'`.
  This is because the long deprecated `str_join()`, `ignore.case()` and 
  `perl()` have now been removed. 

## New features

* `str_glue()` and `str_glue_data()` provide convenient wrappers around
  `glue` and `glue_data()` from the [glue](http://glue.tidyverse.org/) package
  (#157).

* `str_flatten()` is a wrapper around `stri_flatten()` and clearly
  conveys flattening a character vector into a single string (#186).

* `str_remove()` and `str_remove_all()` functions. These wrap 
  `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` to remove patterns from strings.
  (@Shians, #178)
  
* `str_squish()` removes spaces from both the left and right side of strings, 
  and also converts multiple space (or space-like characters) to a single 
  space within strings (@stephlocke, #197).

* `str_sub()` gains `omit_na` argument for ignoring `NA`. Accordingly,
  `str_replace()` now ignores `NA`s and keeps the original strings.
  (@yutannihilation, #164)

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `str_trunc()` now preserves NAs (@ClaytonJY, #162)

* `str_trunc()` now throws an error when `width` is shorter than `ellipsis`
  (@ClaytonJY, #163).

* Long deprecated `str_join()`, `ignore.case()` and `perl()` have now been 
  removed.

# stringr 1.2.0

## API changes

* `str_match_all()` now returns NA if an optional group doesn't match 
  (previously it returned ""). This is more consistent with `str_match()`
  and other match failures (#134).

## New features

* In `str_replace()`, `replacement` can now be a function that is called once
  for each match and whose return value is used to replace the match.

* New `str_which()` mimics `grep()` (#129).

* A new vignette (`vignette("regular-expressions")`) describes the 
  details of the regular expressions supported by stringr.
  The main vignette (`vignette("stringr")`) has been updated to 
  give a high-level overview of the package.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* `str_order()` and `str_sort()` gain explicit `numeric` argument for sorting
  mixed numbers and strings.

* `str_replace_all()` now throws an error if `replacement` is not a character
  vector. If `replacement` is `NA_character_` it replaces the complete string 
  with replaces with `NA` (#124).

* All functions that take a locale (e.g. `str_to_lower()` and `str_sort()`)
  default to "en" (English) to ensure that the default is consistent across
  platforms.
  
# stringr 1.1.0

* Add sample datasets: `fruit`, `words` and `sentences`.

* `fixed()`, `regex()`, and `coll()` now throw an error if you use them with
  anything other than a plain string (#60). I've clarified that the replacement
  for `perl()` is `regex()` not `regexp()` (#61). `boundary()` has improved
  defaults when splitting on non-word boundaries (#58, @lmullen).

* `str_detect()` now can detect boundaries (by checking for a `str_count()` > 0)
  (#120). `str_subset()` works similarly.
  
* `str_extract()` and `str_extract_all()` now work with `boundary()`. This is
  particularly useful if you want to extract logical constructs like words
  or sentences. `str_extract_all()` respects the `simplify` argument
  when used with `fixed()` matches.

* `str_subset()` now respects custom options for `fixed()` patterns 
  (#79, @gagolews).
  
* `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` now behave correctly when a
  replacement string contains `$`s, `\\\\1`, etc. (#83, #99).

* `str_split()` gains a `simplify` argument to match `str_extract_all()` 
  etc.
  
* `str_view()` and `str_view_all()` create HTML widgets that display regular 
  expression matches (#96).
  
* `word()` returns `NA` for indexes greater than number of words (#112).

# stringr 1.0.0

* stringr is now powered by [stringi](https://github.com/Rexamine/stringi) 
  instead of base R regular expressions. This improves unicode and support, and 
  makes most operations considerably faster.  If you find stringr inadequate for
  your string processing needs, I highly recommend looking at stringi in more
  detail.

* stringr gains a vignette, currently a straight forward update of the article
  that appeared in the R Journal.

* `str_c()` now returns a zero length vector if any of its inputs are 
  zero length vectors. This is consistent with all other functions, and
  standard R recycling rules. Similarly, using `str_c("x", NA)` now
  yields `NA`. If you want `"xNA"`, use `str_replace_na()` on the inputs.

* `str_replace_all()` gains a convenient syntax for applying multiple pairs of
  pattern and replacement to the same vector:
  
    ```R
    input <- c("abc", "def")
    str_replace_all(input, c("[ad]" = "!", "[cf]" = "?"))
    ```

* `str_match()` now returns NA if an optional group doesn't match 
  (previously it returned ""). This is more consistent with `str_extract()`
  and other match failures.

* New `str_subset()` keeps values that match a pattern. It's a convenient
  wrapper for `x[str_detect(x)]` (#21, @jiho).

* New `str_order()` and `str_sort()` allow you to sort and order strings
  in a specified locale.

* New `str_conv()` to convert strings from specified encoding to UTF-8.

* New modifier `boundary()` allows you to count, locate and split by
  character, word, line and sentence boundaries.

* The documentation got a lot of love, and very similar functions (e.g.
  first and all variants) are now documented together. This should hopefully
  make it easier to locate the function you need.

* `ignore.case(x)` has been deprecated in favour of 
  `fixed|regex|coll(x, ignore.case = TRUE)`, `perl(x)` has been deprecated in 
  favour of `regex(x)`.

* `str_join()` is deprecated, please use `str_c()` instead.

# stringr 0.6.2

* fixed path in `str_wrap` example so works for more R installations.

* remove dependency on plyr

# stringr 0.6.1

* Zero input to `str_split_fixed` returns 0 row matrix with `n` columns

* Export `str_join`

# stringr 0.6

* new modifier `perl` that switches to Perl regular expressions

* `str_match` now uses new base function `regmatches` to extract matches -
  this should hopefully be faster than my previous pure R algorithm

# stringr 0.5

* new `str_wrap` function which gives `strwrap` output in a more convenient
  format

* new `word` function extract words from a string given user defined
  separator (thanks to suggestion by David Cooper)

* `str_locate` now returns consistent type when matching empty string (thanks
  to Stavros Macrakis)

* new `str_count` counts number of matches in a string.

* `str_pad` and `str_trim` receive performance tweaks - for large vectors this
  should give at least a two order of magnitude speed up

* str_length returns NA for invalid multibyte strings

* fix small bug in internal `recyclable` function

# stringr 0.4

 * all functions now vectorised with respect to string, pattern (and
   where appropriate) replacement parameters
 * fixed() function now tells stringr functions to use fixed matching, rather
   than escaping the regular expression.  Should improve performance for
   large vectors.
 * new ignore.case() modifier tells stringr functions to ignore case of
   pattern.
 * str_replace renamed to str_replace_all and new str_replace function added.
   This makes str_replace consistent with all functions.
 * new str_sub<- function (analogous to substring<-) for substring replacement
 * str_sub now understands negative positions as a position from the end of
   the string. -1 replaces Inf as indicator for string end.
 * str_pad side argument can be left, right, or both (instead of center)
 * str_trim gains side argument to better match str_pad
 * stringr now has a namespace and imports plyr (rather than requiring it)

# stringr 0.3

 * fixed() now also escapes |
 * str_join() renamed to str_c()
 * all functions more carefully check input and return informative error
   messages if not as expected.
 * add invert_match() function to convert a matrix of location of matches to
   locations of non-matches
 * add fixed() function to allow matching of fixed strings.

# stringr 0.2

 * str_length now returns correct results when used with factors
 * str_sub now correctly replaces Inf in end argument with length of string
 * new function str_split_fixed returns fixed number of splits in a character
   matrix
 * str_split no longer uses strsplit to preserve trailing breaks

                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.
Package: stringr
Title: Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations
Version: 1.4.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Hadley",
             family = "Wickham",
             role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),

Description: A consistent, simple and easy to use set of
    wrappers around the fantastic 'stringi' package. All function and
    argument names (and positions) are consistent, all functions deal with
    "NA"'s and zero length vectors in the same way, and the output from
    one function is easy to feed into the input of another.

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Introduction to stringr</h1>



<p>There are four main families of functions in stringr:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Character manipulation: these functions allow you to manipulate individual characters within the strings in character vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Whitespace tools to add, remove, and manipulate whitespace.</p></li>
<li><p>Locale sensitive operations whose operations will vary from locale to locale.</p></li>
<li><p>Pattern matching functions. These recognise four engines of pattern description. The most common is regular expressions, but there are three other tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="getting-and-setting-individual-characters" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting and setting individual characters</h2>
<p>You can get the length of the string with <code>str_length()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_length</span>(<span class="st">&quot;abc&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 3</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is now equivalent to the base R function <code>nchar()</code>. Previously it was needed to work around issues with <code>nchar()</code> such as the fact that it returned 2 for <code>nchar(NA)</code>. This has been fixed as of R 3.3.0, so it is no longer so important.</p>
<p>You can access individual character using <code>str_sub()</code>. It takes three arguments: a character vector, a <code>start</code> position and an <code>end</code> position. Either position can either be a positive integer, which counts from the left, or a negative integer which counts from the right. The positions are inclusive, and if longer than the string, will be silently truncated.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;abcdef&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;ghifjk&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" data-line-number="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co"># The 3rd letter</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw">str_sub</span>(x, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;c&quot; &quot;i&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-6" data-line-number="6"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="co"># The 2nd to 2nd-to-last character</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-8" data-line-number="8"><span class="kw">str_sub</span>(x, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">-2</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-9" data-line-number="9"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;bcde&quot; &quot;hifj&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use <code>str_sub()</code> to modify strings:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_sub</span>(x, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>) &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;X&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">x</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;abXdef&quot; &quot;ghXfjk&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>To duplicate individual strings, you can use <code>str_dup()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_dup</span>(x, <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;abXdefabXdef&quot;       &quot;ghXfjkghXfjkghXfjk&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="whitespace" class="section level2">
<h2>Whitespace</h2>
<p>Three functions add, remove, or modify whitespace:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>str_pad()</code> pads a string to a fixed length by adding extra whitespace on the left, right, or both sides.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;abc&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;defghi&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_pad</span>(x, <span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="co"># default pads on left</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;       abc&quot; &quot;    defghi&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw">str_pad</span>(x, <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="st">&quot;both&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;   abc    &quot; &quot;  defghi  &quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>(You can pad with other characters by using the <code>pad</code> argument.)</p>
<p><code>str_pad()</code> will never make a string shorter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_pad</span>(x, <span class="dv">4</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot; abc&quot;   &quot;defghi&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>So if you want to ensure that all strings are the same length (often useful for print methods), combine <code>str_pad()</code> and <code>str_trunc()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Short&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;This is a long string&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-2" data-line-number="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-3" data-line-number="3">x <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">str_trunc</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">str_pad</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="st">&quot;right&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;Short     &quot; &quot;This is...&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>The opposite of <code>str_pad()</code> is <code>str_trim()</code>, which removes leading and trailing whitespace:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;  a   &quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;b   &quot;</span>,  <span class="st">&quot;   c&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_trim</span>(x)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw">str_trim</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;left&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;a   &quot; &quot;b   &quot; &quot;c&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>You can use <code>str_wrap()</code> to modify existing whitespace in order to wrap a paragraph of text, such that the length of each line is as similar as possible.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1">jabberwocky &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">str_c</span>(</a>

<div id="locale-sensitive" class="section level2">
<h2>Locale sensitive</h2>
<p>A handful of stringr functions are locale-sensitive: they will perform differently in different regions of the world. These functions are case transformation functions:</p>

<p>The locale always defaults to English to ensure that the default behaviour is identical across systems. Locales always include a two letter ISO-639-1 language code (like â€œenâ€ for English or â€œzhâ€ for Chinese), and optionally a ISO-3166 country code (like â€œen_UKâ€ vs â€œen_USâ€). You can see a complete list of available locales by running <code>stringi::stri_locale_list()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pattern-matching" class="section level2">
<h2>Pattern matching</h2>
<p>The vast majority of stringr functions work with patterns. These are parameterised by the task they perform and the types of patterns they match.</p>
<div id="tasks" class="section level3">
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>Each pattern matching function has the same first two arguments, a character vector of <code>string</code>s to process and a single <code>pattern</code> to match. stringr provides pattern matching functions to <strong>detect</strong>, <strong>locate</strong>, <strong>extract</strong>, <strong>match</strong>, <strong>replace</strong>, and <strong>split</strong> strings. Iâ€™ll illustrate how they work with some strings and a regular expression designed to match (US) phone numbers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-1" data-line-number="1">strings &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(</a>

<ul>
<li><p><code>str_detect()</code> detects the presence or absence of a pattern and returns a logical vector (similar to <code>grepl()</code>). <code>str_subset()</code> returns the elements of a character vector that match a regular expression (similar to <code>grep()</code> with <code>value = TRUE</code>)`.</p>

<div id="engines" class="section level3">
<h3>Engines</h3>
<p>There are four main engines that stringr can use to describe patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regular expressions, the default, as shown above, and described in <code>vignette(&quot;regular-expressions&quot;)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bytewise matching, with <code>fixed()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Locale-sensitive character matching, with <code>coll()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Text boundary analysis with <code>boundary()</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="fixed-matches" class="section level4">
<h4>Fixed matches</h4>
<p><code>fixed(x)</code> only matches the exact sequence of bytes specified by <code>x</code>. This is a very limited â€œpatternâ€, but the restriction can make matching much faster. Beware using <code>fixed()</code> with non-English data. It is problematic because there are often multiple ways of representing the same character. For example, there are two ways to define â€œÃ¡â€: either as a single character or as an â€œaâ€ plus an accent:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-1" data-line-number="1">a1 &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;\u00e1&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-2" data-line-number="2">a2 &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;a\u0301&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="kw">c</span>(a1, a2)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;Ã¡&quot; &quot;aÌ&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-5" data-line-number="5">a1 <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> </span>a2</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>They render identically, but because theyâ€™re defined differently, <code>fixed()</code> doesnâ€™t find a match. Instead, you can use <code>coll()</code>, explained below, to respect human character comparison rules:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(a1, <span class="kw">fixed</span>(a2))</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb21-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] TRUE</span></a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="collation-search" class="section level4">
<h4>Collation search</h4>
<p><code>coll(x)</code> looks for a match to <code>x</code> using human-language <strong>coll</strong>ation rules, and is particularly important if you want to do case insensitive matching. Collation rules differ around the world, so youâ€™ll also need to supply a <code>locale</code> parameter.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-1" data-line-number="1">i &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;I&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ä°&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;i&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Ä±&quot;</span>)</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-4" data-line-number="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="kw">str_subset</span>(i, <span class="kw">coll</span>(<span class="st">&quot;i&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ignore_case =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;i&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="kw">str_subset</span>(i, <span class="kw">coll</span>(<span class="st">&quot;i&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ignore_case =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>, <span class="dt">locale =</span> <span class="st">&quot;tr&quot;</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb22-8" data-line-number="8"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;Ä°&quot; &quot;i&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The downside of <code>coll()</code> is speed. Because the rules for recognising which characters are the same are complicated, <code>coll()</code> is relatively slow compared to <code>regex()</code> and <code>fixed()</code>. Note that when both <code>fixed()</code> and <code>regex()</code> have <code>ignore_case</code> arguments, they perform a much simpler comparison than <code>coll()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="boundary" class="section level4">
<h4>Boundary</h4>
<p><code>boundary()</code> matches boundaries between characters, lines, sentences or words. Itâ€™s most useful with <code>str_split()</code>, but can be used with all pattern matching functions:</p>

Regular expressions are a concise and flexible tool for describing patterns in strings. This vignette describes the key features of stringr's regular expressions, as implemented by [stringi](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi). It is not a tutorial, so if you're unfamiliar regular expressions, I'd recommend starting at <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html>. If you want to master the details, I'd recommend reading the classic [_Mastering Regular Expressions_](https://amzn.com/0596528124) by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl. 

Regular expressions are the default pattern engine in stringr. That means when you use a pattern matching function with a bare string, it's equivalent to wrapping it in a call to `regex()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The regular call:
str_extract(fruit, "nana")
# Is shorthand for
str_extract(fruit, regex("nana"))
```

You will need to use `regex()` explicitly if you want to override the default options, as you'll see in examples below.

## Basic matches

The simplest patterns match exact strings:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_extract(x, "an")
```

You can perform a case-insensitive match using `ignore_case = TRUE`:
    
```{r}
bananas <- c("banana", "Banana", "BANANA")
str_detect(bananas, "banana")
str_detect(bananas, regex("banana", ignore_case = TRUE))
```

The next step up in complexity is `.`, which matches any character except a newline:

```{r}
str_extract(x, ".a.")
```

You can allow `.` to match everything, including `\n`, by setting `dotall = TRUE`:

```{r}
str_detect("\nX\n", ".X.")
str_detect("\nX\n", regex(".X.", dotall = TRUE))
```

## Escaping

If "`.`" matches any character, how do you match a literal "`.`"? You need to use an "escape" to tell the regular expression you want to match it exactly, not use its special behaviour. Like strings, regexps use the backslash, `\`, to escape special behaviour. So to match an `.`, you need the regexp `\.`. Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and `\` is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression `\.` we need the string `"\\."`. 

```{r}
# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)

# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
str_extract(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```

If `\` is used as an escape character in regular expressions, how do you match a literal `\`? Well you need to escape it, creating the regular expression `\\`. To create that regular expression, you need to use a string, which also needs to escape `\`. That means to match a literal `\` you need to write `"\\\\"` --- you need four backslashes to match one!

```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)

str_extract(x, "\\\\")
```

In this vignette, I use `\.` to denote the regular expression, and `"\\."` to denote the string that represents the regular expression.

An alternative quoting mechanism is `\Q...\E`: all the characters in `...` are treated as exact matches. This is useful if you want to exactly match user input as part of a regular expression.

```{r}
x <- c("a.b.c.d", "aeb")
starts_with <- "a.b"

str_detect(x, paste0("^", starts_with))
str_detect(x, paste0("^\\Q", starts_with, "\\E"))
```

## Special characters

Escapes also allow you to specify individual characters that are otherwise hard to type. You can specify individual unicode characters in five ways, either as a variable number of hex digits (four is most common), or by name:

* `\xhh`: 2 hex digits.

* `\x{hhhh}`: 1-6 hex digits.

* `\uhhhh`: 4 hex digits.

* `\Uhhhhhhhh`: 8 hex digits.

* `\N{name}`, e.g. `\N{grinning face}` matches the basic smiling emoji.

Similarly, you can specify many common control characters:

* `\a`: bell.

* `\cX`: match a control-X character.

* `\e`: escape  (`\u001B`).

* `\f`: form feed (`\u000C`).

* `\n`: line feed (`\u000A`).

* `\r`: carriage return (`\u000D`).

* `\t`: horizontal tabulation (`\u0009`).

* `\0ooo` match an octal character. 'ooo' is from one to three octal digits, 
  from 000 to 0377. The leading zero is required.

(Many of these are only of historical interest and are only included here for the sake of completeness.)

## Matching multiple characters

There are a number of patterns that match more than one character. You've already seen `.`, which matches any character (except a newline). A closely related operator is `\X`, which matches a __grapheme cluster__, a set of individual elements that form a single symbol. For example, one way of representing "Ã¡" is as the letter "a" plus an accent: `.` will match the component "a", while `\X` will match the complete symbol:
    
```{r}
x <- "a\u0301"
str_extract(x, ".")
str_extract(x, "\\X")
```

There are five other escaped pairs that match narrower classes of characters:
   
*   `\d`: matches any digit. The complement, `\D`, matches any character that 
    is not a decimal digit.

    ```{r}
    str_extract_all("1 + 2 = 3", "\\d+")[[1]]
    ```

    Technically, `\d` includes any character in the Unicode Category of Nd 
    ("Number, Decimal Digit"), which also includes numeric symbols from other 
    languages:
    
    ```{r}
    # Some Laotian numbers
    str_detect("áŸ¡áŸ¢áŸ£", "\\d")
    ```
    
*   `\s`: matches any whitespace. This includes tabs, newlines, form feeds, 
    and any character in the Unicode Z Category (which includes a variety of 
    space characters and other separators.). The complement, `\S`, matches any
    non-whitespace character.
    
    ```{r}
    (text <- "Some  \t badly\n\t\tspaced \f text")
    str_replace_all(text, "\\s+", " ")
    ```

*   `\p{property name}` matches any character with specific unicode property,
    like `\p{Uppercase}` or `\p{Diacritic}`. The complement, 
    `\P{property name}`, matches all characters without the property.
    A complete list of unicode properties can be found at
    <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Property_Index>.
    
    ```{r}
    (text <- c('"Double quotes"', "Â«GuillemetÂ»", "â€œFancy quotesâ€"))
    str_replace_all(text, "\\p{quotation mark}", "'")
    ```

*   `\w` matches any "word" character, which includes alphabetic characters, 
    marks and decimal numbers. The complement, `\W`, matches any non-word
    character.
    
    ```{r}
    str_extract_all("Don't eat that!", "\\w+")[[1]]
    str_split("Don't eat that!", "\\W")[[1]]
    ```
    
    Technically, `\w` also matches connector punctuation, `\u200c` (zero width
    connector), and `\u200d` (zero width joiner), but these are rarely seen in
    the wild.

*   `\b` matches word boundaries, the transition between word and non-word 
    characters. `\B` matches the opposite: boundaries that have either both
    word or non-word characters on either side.
    
    ```{r}
    str_replace_all("The quick brown fox", "\\b", "_")
    str_replace_all("The quick brown fox", "\\B", "_")
    ```

You can also create your own __character classes__ using `[]`:

* `[abc]`: matches a, b, or c.
* `[a-z]`: matches every character between a and z 
   (in Unicode code point order).
* `[^abc]`: matches anything except a, b, or c.
* `[\^\-]`: matches `^` or `-`.

There are a number of pre-built classes that you can use inside `[]`:

* `[:punct:]`: punctuation.
* `[:alpha:]`: letters.
* `[:lower:]`: lowercase letters.
* `[:upper:]`: upperclass letters.
* `[:digit:]`: digits.
* `[:xdigit:]`: hex digits.
* `[:alnum:]`: letters and numbers.
* `[:cntrl:]`: control characters.
* `[:graph:]`: letters, numbers, and punctuation.
* `[:print:]`: letters, numbers, punctuation, and whitespace.
* `[:space:]`: space characters (basically equivalent to `\s`).
* `[:blank:]`: space and tab.

These all go inside the `[]` for character classes, i.e. `[[:digit:]AX]` matches all digits, A, and X.

You can also using Unicode properties, like `[\p{Letter}]`, and various set operations, like `[\p{Letter}--\p{script=latin}]`. See `?"stringi-search-charclass"` for details.

## Alternation

`|` is the __alternation__ operator, which will pick between one or more possible matches. For example, `abc|def` will match `abc` or `def`. 

```{r}
str_detect(c("abc", "def", "ghi"), "abc|def")
```

Note that the precedence for `|` is low, so that `abc|def` matches `abc` or `def` not `abcyz` or `abxyz`. 

## Grouping

You can use parentheses to override the default precedence rules:

```{r}
str_extract(c("grey", "gray"), "gre|ay")
str_extract(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
```

Parenthesis also define "groups" that you can refer to with __backreferences__, like `\1`, `\2` etc, and can be extracted with `str_match()`. For example, the following regular expression finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters:

```{r}
pattern <- "(..)\\1"
fruit %>% 
  str_subset(pattern)

fruit %>% 
  str_subset(pattern) %>% 
  str_match(pattern)
```

You can use `(?:...)`, the non-grouping parentheses, to control precedence but not capture the match in a group. This is slightly more efficient than capturing parentheses.

```{r}
str_match(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
str_match(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(?:e|a)y")
```

This is most useful for more complex cases where you need to capture matches and control precedence independently.

## Anchors

By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. It's often useful to __anchor__ the regular expression so that it matches from the start or end of the string:

* `^` matches the start of string. 
* `$` matches the end of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_extract(x, "^a")
str_extract(x, "a$")
```

To match a literal "$" or "^", you need to escape them, `\$`, and `\^`.

For multiline strings, you can use `regex(multiline = TRUE)`. This changes the behaviour of `^` and `$`, and introduces three new operators:

* `^` now matches the start of each line. 

* `$` now matches the end of each line.

* `\A` matches the start of the input.

* `\z` matches the end of the input.

* `\Z` matches the end of the input, but before the final line terminator, 
  if it exists.

```{r}
x <- "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\n"
str_extract_all(x, "^Line..")[[1]]
str_extract_all(x, regex("^Line..", multiline = TRUE))[[1]]
str_extract_all(x, regex("\\ALine..", multiline = TRUE))[[1]]
```

## Repetition

You can control how many times a pattern matches with the repetition operators:

* `?`: 0 or 1.
* `+`: 1 or more.
* `*`: 0 or more.

```{r}
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_extract(x, "CC?")
str_extract(x, "CC+")
str_extract(x, 'C[LX]+')
```

Note that the precedence of these operators is high, so you can write: `colou?r` to match either American or British spellings. That means most uses will need parentheses, like `bana(na)+`.

You can also specify the number of matches precisely:

* `{n}`: exactly n
* `{n,}`: n or more
* `{n,m}`: between n and m

```{r}
str_extract(x, "C{2}")
str_extract(x, "C{2,}")
str_extract(x, "C{2,3}")
```

By default these matches are "greedy": they will match the longest string possible. You can make them "lazy", matching the shortest string possible by putting a `?` after them:

* `??`: 0 or 1, prefer 0.
* `+?`: 1 or more, match as few times as possible.
* `*?`: 0 or more, match as few times as possible.
* `{n,}?`: n or more, match as few times as possible.
* `{n,m}?`: between n and m, , match as few times as possible, but at least n.

```{r}
str_extract(x, c("C{2,3}", "C{2,3}?"))
str_extract(x, c("C[LX]+", "C[LX]+?"))
```

You can also make the matches possessive by putting a `+` after them, which means that if later parts of the match fail, the repetition will not be re-tried with a smaller number of characters. This is an advanced feature used to improve performance in worst-case scenarios (called "catastrophic backtracking").

* `?+`: 0 or 1, possessive.
* `++`: 1 or more, possessive.
* `*+`: 0 or more, possessive.
* `{n}+`: exactly n, possessive.
* `{n,}+`: n or more, possessive.
* `{n,m}+`: between n and m, possessive.

A related concept is the __atomic-match__ parenthesis, `(?>...)`. If a later match fails and the engine needs to back-track, an atomic match is kept as is: it succeeds or fails as a whole. Compare the following two regular expressions:

```{r}
str_detect("ABC", "(?>A|.B)C")
str_detect("ABC", "(?:A|.B)C")
```

The atomic match fails because it matches A, and then the next character is a C so it fails. The regular match succeeds because it matches A, but then C doesn't match, so it back-tracks and tries B instead.

## Look arounds

These assertions look ahead or behind the current match without "consuming" any characters (i.e. changing the input position).

* `(?=...)`: positive look-ahead assertion. Matches if `...` matches at the 
  current input.
  
* `(?!...)`: negative look-ahead assertion. Matches if `...` __does not__ 
  match at the current input.
  
* `(?<=...)`: positive look-behind assertion. Matches if `...` matches text 
  preceding the current position, with the last character of the match 
  being the character just before the current position. Length must be bounded  
  (i.e. no `*` or `+`).

* `(?<!...)`: negative look-behind assertion. Matches if `...` __does not__
  match text preceding the current position. Length must be bounded  
  (i.e. no `*` or `+`).

These are useful when you want to check that a pattern exists, but you don't want to include it in the result:

```{r}
x <- c("1 piece", "2 pieces", "3")
str_extract(x, "\\d+(?= pieces?)")

y <- c("100", "$400")
str_extract(y, "(?<=\\$)\\d+")
```

## Comments

There are two ways to include comments in a regular expression. The first is with `(?#...)`:

```{r}
str_detect("xyz", "x(?#this is a comment)")
```

The second is to use `regex(comments = TRUE)`. This form ignores spaces and newlines, and anything everything after `#`. To match a literal space, you'll need to escape it: `"\\ "`. This is a useful way of describing complex regular expressions:

```{r}
phone <- regex("
  \\(?     # optional opening parens
  (\\d{3}) # area code
  [)- ]?   # optional closing parens, dash, or space
  (\\d{3}) # another three numbers
  [ -]?    # optional space or dash
  (\\d{3}) # three more numbers
  ", comments = TRUE)

str_match("514-791-8141", phone)
```

There are four main families of functions in stringr: 

1.  Character manipulation: these functions allow you to manipulate 
    individual characters within the strings in character vectors.
   
1.  Whitespace tools to add, remove, and manipulate whitespace.

1.  Locale sensitive operations whose operations will vary from locale
    to locale.
    
1.  Pattern matching functions. These recognise four engines of
    pattern description. The most common is regular expressions, but there
    are three other tools.

## Getting and setting individual characters

You can get the length of the string with `str_length()`:

```{r}
str_length("abc")
```

This is now equivalent to the base R function `nchar()`. Previously it was needed to work around issues with `nchar()` such as the fact that it returned 2 for `nchar(NA)`. This has been fixed as of R 3.3.0, so it is no longer so important.

You can access individual character using `str_sub()`. It takes three arguments: a character vector, a `start` position and an `end` position. Either position can either be a positive integer, which counts from the left, or a negative integer which counts from the right. The positions are inclusive, and if longer than the string, will be silently truncated.

```{r}
x <- c("abcdef", "ghifjk")

# The 3rd letter
str_sub(x, 3, 3)

# The 2nd to 2nd-to-last character
str_sub(x, 2, -2)

```

You can also use `str_sub()` to modify strings:

```{r}
str_sub(x, 3, 3) <- "X"
x
```

To duplicate individual strings, you can use `str_dup()`:

```{r}
str_dup(x, c(2, 3))
```

## Whitespace

Three functions add, remove, or modify whitespace:

1. `str_pad()` pads a string to a fixed length by adding extra whitespace on 
    the left, right, or both sides.
    
    ```{r}
    x <- c("abc", "defghi")
    str_pad(x, 10) # default pads on left
    str_pad(x, 10, "both")
    ```
    
    (You can pad with other characters by using the `pad` argument.)
    
    `str_pad()` will never make a string shorter:
    
    ```{r}
    str_pad(x, 4)
    ```
    
    So if you want to ensure that all strings are the same length (often useful
    for print methods), combine `str_pad()` and `str_trunc()`:
    
    ```{r}
    x <- c("Short", "This is a long string")
    
    x %>% 
      str_trunc(10) %>% 
      str_pad(10, "right")
    ```

1.  The opposite of `str_pad()` is `str_trim()`, which removes leading and 
    trailing whitespace:
    
    ```{r}
    x <- c("  a   ", "b   ",  "   c")
    str_trim(x)
    str_trim(x, "left")
    ```

1.  You can use `str_wrap()` to modify existing whitespace in order to wrap
    a paragraph of text, such that the length of each line is as similar as 
    possible. 
    
    ```{r}
    jabberwocky <- str_c(
      "`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves ",
      "did gyre and gimble in the wabe: ",
      "All mimsy were the borogoves, ",
      "and the mome raths outgrabe. "
    )
    cat(str_wrap(jabberwocky, width = 40))
    ```

## Locale sensitive

A handful of stringr functions are locale-sensitive: they will perform differently in different regions of the world. These functions are case transformation functions:

```{r}
x <- "I like horses."
str_to_upper(x)
str_to_title(x)

str_to_lower(x)
# Turkish has two sorts of i: with and without the dot
str_to_lower(x, "tr")
```

String ordering and sorting:

```{r}
x <- c("y", "i", "k")
str_order(x)

str_sort(x)
# In Lithuanian, y comes between i and k
str_sort(x, locale = "lt")
```

The locale always defaults to English to ensure that the default behaviour is identical across systems. Locales always include a two letter ISO-639-1 language code (like "en" for English or "zh" for Chinese), and optionally a ISO-3166 country code (like "en_UK" vs "en_US"). You can see a complete list of available locales by running `stringi::stri_locale_list()`.

## Pattern matching

The vast majority of stringr functions work with patterns. These are parameterised by the task they perform and the types of patterns they match.

### Tasks

Each pattern matching function has the same first two arguments, a character vector of `string`s to process and a single `pattern` to match. stringr provides pattern matching functions to **detect**, **locate**, **extract**, **match**, **replace**, and **split** strings. I'll illustrate how they work with some strings and a regular expression designed to match (US) phone numbers:

```{r}
strings <- c(
  "apple", 
  "219 733 8965", 
  "329-293-8753", 
  "Work: 579-499-7527; Home: 543.355.3679"
)
phone <- "([2-9][0-9]{2})[- .]([0-9]{3})[- .]([0-9]{4})"
```

-   `str_detect()` detects the presence or absence of a pattern and returns a 
    logical vector (similar to `grepl()`). `str_subset()` returns the elements
    of a character vector that match a regular expression (similar to `grep()` 
    with `value = TRUE`)`.
    
    ```{r}
    # Which strings contain phone numbers?
    str_detect(strings, phone)
    str_subset(strings, phone)
    ```

-  `str_count()` counts the number of matches:

    ```{r}
    # How many phone numbers in each string?
    str_count(strings, phone)
    ```

-   `str_locate()` locates the **first** position of a pattern and returns a numeric 
    matrix with columns start and end. `str_locate_all()` locates all matches, 
    returning a list of numeric matrices. Similar to `regexpr()` and `gregexpr()`.

    ```{r}
    # Where in the string is the phone number located?
    (loc <- str_locate(strings, phone))
    str_locate_all(strings, phone)
    ```

-   `str_extract()` extracts text corresponding to the **first** match, returning a 
    character vector. `str_extract_all()` extracts all matches and returns a 
    list of character vectors.

    ```{r}
    # What are the phone numbers?
    str_extract(strings, phone)
    str_extract_all(strings, phone)
    str_extract_all(strings, phone, simplify = TRUE)
    ```

-   `str_match()` extracts capture groups formed by `()` from the **first** match. 
    It returns a character matrix with one column for the complete match and 
    one column for each group. `str_match_all()` extracts capture groups from 
    all matches and returns a list of character matrices. Similar to 
    `regmatches()`.

    ```{r}
    # Pull out the three components of the match
    str_match(strings, phone)
    str_match_all(strings, phone)
    ```

-   `str_replace()` replaces the **first** matched pattern and returns a character
    vector. `str_replace_all()` replaces all matches. Similar to `sub()` and 
    `gsub()`.

    ```{r}
    str_replace(strings, phone, "XXX-XXX-XXXX")
    str_replace_all(strings, phone, "XXX-XXX-XXXX")
    ```

-   `str_split_fixed()` splits a string into a **fixed** number of pieces based 
    on a pattern and returns a character matrix. `str_split()` splits a string 
    into a **variable** number of pieces and returns a list of character vectors.
    
    ```{r}
    str_split("a-b-c", "-")
    str_split_fixed("a-b-c", "-", n = 2)
    ```

### Engines

There are four main engines that stringr can use to describe patterns:

* Regular expressions, the default, as shown above, and described in
  `vignette("regular-expressions")`. 
  
* Fixed bytewise matching, with `fixed()`.

* Locale-sensitive character matching, with `coll()`

* Text boundary analysis with `boundary()`.

#### Fixed matches

`fixed(x)` only matches the exact sequence of bytes specified by `x`. This is a very limited "pattern", but the restriction can make matching much faster. Beware using `fixed()` with non-English data. It is problematic because there are often multiple ways of representing the same character. For  example, there are two ways to define "Ã¡": either as a single character or as an "a" plus an accent:

```{r}
a1 <- "\u00e1"
a2 <- "a\u0301"
c(a1, a2)
a1 == a2
```

They render identically, but because they're defined differently, 
`fixed()` doesn't find a match. Instead, you can use `coll()`, explained
below, to respect human character comparison rules:

```{r}
str_detect(a1, fixed(a2))
str_detect(a1, coll(a2))
```
    
#### Collation search
    
`coll(x)` looks for a match to `x` using human-language **coll**ation rules, and is particularly important if you want to do case insensitive matching. Collation rules differ around the world, so you'll also need to supply a `locale` parameter.

```{r}
i <- c("I", "Ä°", "i", "Ä±")
i

str_subset(i, coll("i", ignore_case = TRUE))
str_subset(i, coll("i", ignore_case = TRUE, locale = "tr"))
```

The downside of `coll()` is speed. Because the rules for recognising which characters are the same are complicated, `coll()` is relatively slow compared to `regex()` and `fixed()`. Note that when both `fixed()` and `regex()` have `ignore_case` arguments, they perform a much simpler comparison than `coll()`.

#### Boundary

`boundary()` matches boundaries between characters, lines, sentences or words. It's most useful with `str_split()`, but can be used with all pattern matching functions:

```{r}
x <- "This is a sentence."
str_split(x, boundary("word"))
str_count(x, boundary("word"))
str_extract_all(x, boundary("word"))
```

By convention, `""` is treated as `boundary("character")`:

```{r}
str_split(x, "")
str_count(x, "")
```

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Regular expressions</h1>



<p>Regular expressions are a concise and flexible tool for describing patterns in strings. This vignette describes the key features of stringrâ€™s regular expressions, as implemented by <a href="https://github.com/gagolews/stringi">stringi</a>. It is not a tutorial, so if youâ€™re unfamiliar regular expressions, Iâ€™d recommend starting at <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html" class="uri">http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html</a>. If you want to master the details, Iâ€™d recommend reading the classic <a href="https://amzn.com/0596528124"><em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em></a> by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are the default pattern engine in stringr. That means when you use a pattern matching function with a bare string, itâ€™s equivalent to wrapping it in a call to <code>regex()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># The regular call:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(fruit, <span class="st">&quot;nana&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co"># Is shorthand for</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(fruit, <span class="kw">regex</span>(<span class="st">&quot;nana&quot;</span>))</a></code></pre></div>
<p>You will need to use <code>regex()</code> explicitly if you want to override the default options, as youâ€™ll see in examples below.</p>
<div id="basic-matches" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic matches</h2>
<p>The simplest patterns match exact strings:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;pear&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;an&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] NA   &quot;an&quot; NA</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can perform a case-insensitive match using <code>ignore_case = TRUE</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">bananas &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Banana&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;BANANA&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(bananas, <span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(bananas, <span class="kw">regex</span>(<span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ignore_case =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The next step up in complexity is <code>.</code>, which matches any character except a newline:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;.a.&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] NA    &quot;ban&quot; &quot;ear&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can allow <code>.</code> to match everything, including <code>\n</code>, by setting <code>dotall = TRUE</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">X</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;.X.&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">X</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">regex</span>(<span class="st">&quot;.X.&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">dotall =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] TRUE</span></a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="escaping" class="section level2">
<h2>Escaping</h2>
<p>If â€œ<code>.</code>â€ matches any character, how do you match a literal â€œ<code>.</code>â€? You need to use an â€œescapeâ€ to tell the regular expression you want to match it exactly, not use its special behaviour. Like strings, regexps use the backslash, <code>\</code>, to escape special behaviour. So to match an <code>.</code>, you need the regexp <code>\.</code>. Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and <code>\</code> is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression <code>\.</code> we need the string <code>&quot;\\.&quot;</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># To create the regular expression, we need \\</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2">dot &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">.&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-3" data-line-number="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co"># But the expression itself only contains one:</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="kw">writeLines</span>(dot)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="co">#&gt; \.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-7" data-line-number="7"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-8" data-line-number="8"><span class="co"># And this tells R to look for an explicit .</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-9" data-line-number="9"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;abc&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;a.c&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;bef&quot;</span>), <span class="st">&quot;a</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">.c&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-10" data-line-number="10"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] NA    &quot;a.c&quot; NA</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>If <code>\</code> is used as an escape character in regular expressions, how do you match a literal <code>\</code>? Well you need to escape it, creating the regular expression <code>\\</code>. To create that regular expression, you need to use a string, which also needs to escape <code>\</code>. That means to match a literal <code>\</code> you need to write <code>&quot;\\\\&quot;</code> â€” you need four backslashes to match one!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;a</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">b&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">writeLines</span>(x)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; a\b</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-4" data-line-number="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\\\\</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;\\&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this vignette, I use <code>\.</code> to denote the regular expression, and <code>&quot;\\.&quot;</code> to denote the string that represents the regular expression.</p>
<p>An alternative quoting mechanism is <code>\Q...\E</code>: all the characters in <code>...</code> are treated as exact matches. This is useful if you want to exactly match user input as part of a regular expression.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;a.b.c.d&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;aeb&quot;</span>)</a>

</div>
<div id="special-characters" class="section level2">
<h2>Special characters</h2>
<p>Escapes also allow you to specify individual characters that are otherwise hard to type. You can specify individual unicode characters in five ways, either as a variable number of hex digits (four is most common), or by name:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>\xhh</code>: 2 hex digits.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\x{hhhh}</code>: 1-6 hex digits.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\uhhhh</code>: 4 hex digits.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\Uhhhhhhhh</code>: 8 hex digits.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\N{name}</code>, e.g. <code>\N{grinning face}</code> matches the basic smiling emoji.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, you can specify many common control characters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>\a</code>: bell.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\cX</code>: match a control-X character.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\e</code>: escape (<code>\u001B</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>\f</code>: form feed (<code>\u000C</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>\n</code>: line feed (<code>\u000A</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>\r</code>: carriage return (<code>\u000D</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>\t</code>: horizontal tabulation (<code>\u0009</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>\0ooo</code> match an octal character. â€˜oooâ€™ is from one to three octal digits, from 000 to 0377. The leading zero is required.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(Many of these are only of historical interest and are only included here for the sake of completeness.)</p>
</div>
<div id="matching-multiple-characters" class="section level2">
<h2>Matching multiple characters</h2>
<p>There are a number of patterns that match more than one character. Youâ€™ve already seen <code>.</code>, which matches any character (except a newline). A closely related operator is <code>\X</code>, which matches a <strong>grapheme cluster</strong>, a set of individual elements that form a single symbol. For example, one way of representing â€œÃ¡â€ is as the letter â€œaâ€ plus an accent: <code>.</code> will match the component â€œaâ€, while <code>\X</code> will match the complete symbol:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;a\u0301&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;.&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">X&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;aÌ&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>There are five other escaped pairs that match narrower classes of characters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>\d</code>: matches any digit. The complement, <code>\D</code>, matches any character that is not a decimal digit.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_extract_all</span>(<span class="st">&quot;1 + 2 = 3&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">d+&quot;</span>)[[<span class="dv">1</span>]]</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Technically, <code>\d</code> includes any character in the Unicode Category of Nd (â€œNumber, Decimal Digitâ€), which also includes numeric symbols from other languages:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># Some Laotian numbers</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="st">&quot;áŸ¡áŸ¢áŸ£&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">d&quot;</span>)</a>

<p>You can also create your own <strong>character classes</strong> using <code>[]</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[abc]</code>: matches a, b, or c.</li>
<li><code>[a-z]</code>: matches every character between a and z (in Unicode code point order).</li>
<li><code>[^abc]</code>: matches anything except a, b, or c.</li>
<li><code>[\^\-]</code>: matches <code>^</code> or <code>-</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of pre-built classes that you can use inside <code>[]</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[:punct:]</code>: punctuation.</li>
<li><code>[:alpha:]</code>: letters.</li>
<li><code>[:lower:]</code>: lowercase letters.</li>
<li><code>[:upper:]</code>: upperclass letters.</li>
<li><code>[:digit:]</code>: digits.</li>
<li><code>[:xdigit:]</code>: hex digits.</li>
<li><code>[:alnum:]</code>: letters and numbers.</li>
<li><code>[:cntrl:]</code>: control characters.</li>
<li><code>[:graph:]</code>: letters, numbers, and punctuation.</li>
<li><code>[:print:]</code>: letters, numbers, punctuation, and whitespace.</li>
<li><code>[:space:]</code>: space characters (basically equivalent to <code>\s</code>).</li>
<li><code>[:blank:]</code>: space and tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>These all go inside the <code>[]</code> for character classes, i.e. <code>[[:digit:]AX]</code> matches all digits, A, and X.</p>
<p>You can also using Unicode properties, like <code>[\p{Letter}]</code>, and various set operations, like <code>[\p{Letter}--\p{script=latin}]</code>. See <code>?&quot;stringi-search-charclass&quot;</code> for details.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternation" class="section level2">
<h2>Alternation</h2>
<p><code>|</code> is the <strong>alternation</strong> operator, which will pick between one or more possible matches. For example, <code>abc|def</code> will match <code>abc</code> or <code>def</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;abc&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;def&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;ghi&quot;</span>), <span class="st">&quot;abc|def&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb16-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the precedence for <code>|</code> is low, so that <code>abc|def</code> matches <code>abc</code> or <code>def</code> not <code>abcyz</code> or <code>abxyz</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="grouping" class="section level2">
<h2>Grouping</h2>
<p>You can use parentheses to override the default precedence rules:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;grey&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;gray&quot;</span>), <span class="st">&quot;gre|ay&quot;</span>)</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb17-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] &quot;grey&quot; &quot;gray&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Parenthesis also define â€œgroupsâ€ that you can refer to with <strong>backreferences</strong>, like <code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code> etc, and can be extracted with <code>str_match()</code>. For example, the following regular expression finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-1" data-line-number="1">pattern &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;(..)</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">1&quot;</span></a>

<p>You can use <code>(?:...)</code>, the non-grouping parentheses, to control precedence but not capture the match in a group. This is slightly more efficient than capturing parentheses.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_match</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;grey&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;gray&quot;</span>), <span class="st">&quot;gr(e|a)y&quot;</span>)</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb19-8" data-line-number="8"><span class="co">#&gt; [2,] &quot;gray&quot;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is most useful for more complex cases where you need to capture matches and control precedence independently.</p>
</div>
<div id="anchors" class="section level2">
<h2>Anchors</h2>
<p>By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. Itâ€™s often useful to <strong>anchor</strong> the regular expression so that it matches from the start or end of the string:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^</code> matches the start of string.</li>
<li><code>$</code> matches the end of the string.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-1" data-line-number="1">x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;apple&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;banana&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;pear&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="st">&quot;^a&quot;</span>)</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb20-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] NA  &quot;a&quot; NA</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>To match a literal â€œ$â€ or â€œ^â€, you need to escape them, <code>\$</code>, and <code>\^</code>.</p>
<p>For multiline strings, you can use <code>regex(multiline = TRUE)</code>. This changes the behaviour of <code>^</code> and <code>$</code>, and introduces three new operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>^</code> now matches the start of each line.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$</code> now matches the end of each line.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\A</code> matches the start of the input.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\z</code> matches the end of the input.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\Z</code> matches the end of the input, but before the final line terminator, if it exists.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="repetition" class="section level2">
<h2>Repetition</h2>
<p>You can control how many times a pattern matches with the repetition operators:</p>

<p>Note that the precedence of these operators is high, so you can write: <code>colou?r</code> to match either American or British spellings. That means most uses will need parentheses, like <code>bana(na)+</code>.</p>
<p>You can also specify the number of matches precisely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{n}</code>: exactly n</li>
<li><code>{n,}</code>: n or more</li>
<li><code>{n,m}</code>: between n and m</li>
</ul>

<p>By default these matches are â€œgreedyâ€: they will match the longest string possible. You can make them â€œlazyâ€, matching the shortest string possible by putting a <code>?</code> after them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>??</code>: 0 or 1, prefer 0.</li>
<li><code>+?</code>: 1 or more, match as few times as possible.</li>
<li><code>*?</code>: 0 or more, match as few times as possible.</li>
<li><code>{n,}?</code>: n or more, match as few times as possible.</li>
<li><code>{n,m}?</code>: between n and m, , match as few times as possible, but at least n.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb24-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_extract</span>(x, <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;C{2,3}&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;C{2,3}?&quot;</span>))</a>

<p>You can also make the matches possessive by putting a <code>+</code> after them, which means that if later parts of the match fail, the repetition will not be re-tried with a smaller number of characters. This is an advanced feature used to improve performance in worst-case scenarios (called â€œcatastrophic backtrackingâ€).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>?+</code>: 0 or 1, possessive.</li>
<li><code>++</code>: 1 or more, possessive.</li>
<li><code>*+</code>: 0 or more, possessive.</li>
<li><code>{n}+</code>: exactly n, possessive.</li>
<li><code>{n,}+</code>: n or more, possessive.</li>
<li><code>{n,m}+</code>: between n and m, possessive.</li>
</ul>
<p>A related concept is the <strong>atomic-match</strong> parenthesis, <code>(?&gt;...)</code>. If a later match fails and the engine needs to back-track, an atomic match is kept as is: it succeeds or fails as a whole. Compare the following two regular expressions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="st">&quot;ABC&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;(?&gt;A|.B)C&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="st">&quot;ABC&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;(?:A|.B)C&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] TRUE</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The atomic match fails because it matches A, and then the next character is a C so it fails. The regular match succeeds because it matches A, but then C doesnâ€™t match, so it back-tracks and tries B instead.</p>
</div>
<div id="look-arounds" class="section level2">
<h2>Look arounds</h2>
<p>These assertions look ahead or behind the current match without â€œconsumingâ€ any characters (i.e.Â changing the input position).</p>
<ul>

<li><p><code>(?!...)</code>: negative look-ahead assertion. Matches if <code>...</code> <strong>does not</strong> match at the current input.</p></li>
<li><p><code>(?&lt;=...)</code>: positive look-behind assertion. Matches if <code>...</code> matches text preceding the current position, with the last character of the match being the character just before the current position. Length must be bounded<br />
(i.e.Â no <code>*</code> or <code>+</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>(?&lt;!...)</code>: negative look-behind assertion. Matches if <code>...</code> <strong>does not</strong> match text preceding the current position. Length must be bounded<br />
(i.e.Â no <code>*</code> or <code>+</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are useful when you want to check that a pattern exists, but you donâ€™t want to include it in the result:</p>

<div id="comments" class="section level2">
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>There are two ways to include comments in a regular expression. The first is with <code>(?#...)</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb27-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">str_detect</span>(<span class="st">&quot;xyz&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;x(?#this is a comment)&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb27-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co">#&gt; [1] TRUE</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The second is to use <code>regex(comments = TRUE)</code>. This form ignores spaces and newlines, and anything everything after <code>#</code>. To match a literal space, youâ€™ll need to escape it: <code>&quot;\\ &quot;</code>. This is a useful way of describing complex regular expressions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-1" data-line-number="1">phone &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">regex</span>(<span class="st">&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="st">  </span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">(?     # optional opening parens</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="st">  (</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">d{3}) # area code</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="st">  [)- ]?   # optional closing parens, dash, or space</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="st">  (</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">d{3}) # another three numbers</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-6" data-line-number="6"><span class="st">  [ -]?    # optional space or dash</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb28-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="st">  (</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="st">d{3}) # three more numbers</span></a>
