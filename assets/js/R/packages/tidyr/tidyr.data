# tidyr 1.2.0

## Pivoting

* `pivot_wider()` gains new `names_expand` and `id_expand` arguments for turning
  implicit missing factor levels and variable combinations into explicit ones.
  This is similar to the `drop` argument from `spread()` (#770).

* `pivot_wider()` gains a new `names_vary` argument for controlling the
  ordering when combining `names_from` values with `values_from` column names
  (#839).

* `pivot_wider()` gains a new `unused_fn` argument for controlling how to
  summarize unused columns that aren't involved in the pivoting process (#990,
  thanks to @mgirlich for an initial implementation).

* `pivot_longer()`'s `names_transform` and `values_transform` arguments now
  accept a single function which will be applied to all of the columns
  (#1284, thanks to @smingerson for an initial implementation).
  
* `pivot_longer()`'s `names_ptypes` and `values_ptypes` arguments now
  accept a single empty ptype which will be applied to all of the columns
  (#1284).

## Nesting

* `unnest()` and `unchop()`'s `ptype` argument now accepts a single empty
  ptype which will be applied to all `cols` (#1284).

* `unpack()` now silently skips over any non-data frame columns specified by
  `cols`. This matches the existing behavior of `unchop()` and `unnest()`
  (#1153).

## Rectangling

* `unnest_wider()` and `unnest_longer()` can now unnest multiple columns at
  once (#740).
  
* `unnest_longer()`'s `indices_to` and `values_to` arguments now accept
  a glue specification, which is useful when unnesting multiple columns.
  
* For `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`, if a `ptype` is
  supplied, but that column can't be simplified, the result will be a list-of
  column where each element has type `ptype` (#998).
  
* `unnest_wider()` gains a new `strict` argument which controls whether or not
  strict vctrs typing rules should be applied. It defaults to `FALSE` for
  backwards compatibility, and because it is often more useful to be lax
  when unnesting JSON, which doesn't always map one-to-one with R's types
  (#1125).

* `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `simplify` argument now
  accepts a named list of `TRUE` or `FALSE` to control simplification on a per
  column basis (#995).

* `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `transform` argument now
  accepts a single function which will be applied to all components (#1284).

* `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`'s `ptype` argument now
  accepts a single empty ptype which will be applied to all components (#1284).

## Grids

* `complete()` gains a new `explicit` argument for limiting `fill` to only
  implicit missing values. This is useful if you don't want to fill in
  pre-existing missing values (#1270).

* `complete()` gains a grouped data frame method. This generates a more correct
  completed data frame when groups are involved (#396, #966).
  
* `complete()` and `expand()` no longer allow you to complete or expand on a
  grouping column. This was never well-defined since completion/expansion on a
  grouped data frame happens "within" each group and otherwise has the
  potential to produce erroneous results (#1299).

## Missing values

* `drop_na()`, `replace_na()`, and `fill()` have been updated to utilize vctrs.
  This means that you can use these functions on a wider variety of column
  types, including lubridate's Period types (#1094), data frame columns, and
  the [rcrd](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/new_rcrd.html) type from vctrs.

* `replace_na()` no longer allows the type of `data` to change when the
  replacement is applied. `replace` will now always be cast to the type of
  `data` before the replacement is made. For example, this means that using a
  replacement value of `1.5` on an integer column is no longer allowed.
  Similarly, replacing missing values in a list-column must now be done with
  `list("foo")` rather than just `"foo"`.

* `replace_na()` no longer replaces empty atomic elements in list-columns
  (like `integer(0)`). The only value that is replaced in a list-column is
  `NULL` (#1168).

* `drop_na()` no longer drops empty atomic elements from list-columns
  (like `integer(0)`). The only value that is dropped in a list-column is
  `NULL` (#1228).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

### General

* @mgirlich is now a tidyr author in recognition of his significant and
  sustained contributions.
  
* All lazyeval variants of tidyr verbs have been soft-deprecated. Expect them
  to move to the defunct stage in the next minor release of tidyr (#1294).
  
* `any_of()` and `all_of()` from tidyselect are now re-exported (#1217).

* dplyr >= 1.0.0 is now required.
  
### Pivoting
  
* `pivot_wider()` now gives better advice about how to identify duplicates when
  values are not uniquely identified (#1113).

* `pivot_wider()` now throws a more informative error when `values_fn` doesn't
  result in a single summary value (#1238).

* `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` now generate more informative
  errors related to name repair (#987).

* `pivot_wider()` now works correctly when `values_fill` is a data frame.

* `pivot_wider()` no longer accidentally retains `values_from` when pivoting
  a zero row data frame (#1249).

* `pivot_wider()` now correctly handles the case where an id column name
  collides with a value from `names_from` (#1107).

* `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` now both check that the spec columns
  `.name` and `.value` are character vectors. Additionally, the `.name`
  column must be unique (#1107).
  
* `pivot_wider()`'s `names_from` and `values_from` arguments are now
  required if their default values of `name` and `value` don't correspond to
  columns in `data`. Additionally, they must identify at least 1 column
  in `data` (#1240).

* `pivot_wider()`'s `values_fn` argument now correctly allows anonymous
  functions (#1114).

* `pivot_wider_spec()` now works correctly with a 0-row data frame and a `spec`
  that doesn't identify any rows (#1250, #1252).

* `pivot_longer()`'s `names_ptypes` argument is now applied after
  `names_transform` for consistency with the rectangling functions
  (i.e. `hoist()`) (#1233).

* `check_pivot_spec()` is a new developer facing function for validating a pivot
  `spec` argument. This is only useful if you are extending `pivot_longer()` or
  `pivot_wider()` with new S3 methods (#1087).

### Nesting

* The `nest()` generic now avoids computing on `.data`, making it more
  compatible with lazy tibbles (#1134).
  
* The `.names_sep` argument of the data.frame method for `nest()` is now
  actually used (#1174).
  
* `unnest()`'s `ptype` argument now works as expected (#1158).
  
* `unpack()` no longer drops empty columns specified through `cols` (#1191).

* `unpack()` now works correctly with data frame columns containing 1 row but
  0 columns (#1189).
  
* `chop()` now works correctly with data frames with 0 rows (#1206).

* `chop()`'s `cols` argument is no longer optional. This matches the
  behavior of `cols` seen elsewhere in tidyr (#1205).
  
* `unchop()` now respects `ptype` when unnesting a non-list column (#1211).

### Rectangling

* `hoist()` no longer accidentally removes elements that have duplicated names
  (#1259).

### Grids

* The grouped data frame methods for `complete()` and `expand()` now move the
  group columns to the front of the result (in addition to the columns you
  completed on or expanded, which were already moved to the front). This should
  make more intuitive sense, as you are completing or expanding "within" each
  group, so the group columns should be the first thing you see (#1289).

* `complete()` now applies `fill` even when no columns to complete are
  specified (#1272).

* `expand()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` now correctly retain `NA` values of
  factors (#1275).
    
* `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now silently
  apply name repair to automatically named inputs. This avoids a number of
  issues resulting from duplicate truncated names
  (#1116, #1221, #1092, #1037, #992).
  
* `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now allow
  columns from unnamed data frames to be used in expressions after that
  data frame was specified, like `expand_grid(tibble(x = 1), y = x)`. This
  is more consistent with how `tibble()` behaves.
  
* `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now work
  correctly with data frames containing 0 columns but >0 rows (#1189).

* `expand_grid()`, `expand()`, `nesting()`, and `crossing()` now return a 1
  row data frame when no inputs are supplied, which is more consistent with
  `prod() == 1L` and the idea that computations involving the number of
  combinations computed from an empty set should return 1 (#1258).

### Missing values

* `drop_na()` no longer drops missing values from all columns when a tidyselect
  expression that results in 0 columns being selected is used (#1227).

* `fill()` now treats `NaN` like any other missing value (#982).

# tidyr 1.1.4

* `expand_grid()` is now about twice as fast and `pivot_wider()` is a bit faster
  (@mgirlich, #1130).

* `unchop()` is now much faster, which propagates through to various functions,
  such as `unnest()`, `unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`, and
  `separate_rows()` (@mgirlich, @DavisVaughan, #1127).

* `unnest()` is now much faster (@mgirlich, @DavisVaughan, #1127).

* `unnest()` no longer allows unnesting a list-col containing a mix of vector
  and data frame elements. Previously, this only worked by accident, and is
  considered an off-label usage of `unnest()` that has now become an error.

# tidyr 1.1.3

* tidyr verbs no longer have "default" methods for lazyeval fallbacks. This
  means that you'll get clearer error messages (#1036).

* `uncount()` error for non-integer weights and gives a clearer error message
  for negative weights (@mgirlich, #1069).

* You can once again unnest dates (#1021, #1089).

* `pivot_wider()` works with data.table and empty key variables (@mgirlich, #1066).

* `separate_rows()` works for factor columns (@mgirlich, #1058).

# tidyr 1.1.2

* `separate_rows()` returns to 1.1.0 behaviour for empty strings 
  (@rjpatm, #1014).

# tidyr 1.1.1

* New tidyr logo!

* stringi dependency has been removed; this was a substantial dependency that
  make tidyr hard to compile in resource constrained environments 
  (@rjpat, #936).
  
* Replace Rcpp with cpp11. See <https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html>
  for reasons why.

# tidyr 1.1.0

## General features

* `pivot_longer()`, `hoist()`, `unnest_wider()`, and `unnest_longer()` gain
  new `transform` arguments; these allow you to transform values "in flight". 
  They are partly needed because vctrs coercion rules have become stricter,
  but they give you greater flexibility than was available previously (#921).

* Arguments that use tidy selection syntax are now clearly documented and 
  have been updated to use tidyselect 1.1.0 (#872).

## Pivoting improvements

* Both `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are considerably more performant, 
  thanks largely to improvements in the underlying vctrs code 
  (#790, @DavisVaughan).
  
* `pivot_longer()` now supports `names_to = character()` which prevents the
  name column from being created (#961).

    ```{r}
    df <- tibble(id = 1:3, x_1 = 1:3, x_2 = 4:6)  
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_to = character())
    ```

* `pivot_longer()` no longer creates a `.copy` variable in the presence of
  duplicate column names. This makes it more consistent with the handling
  of non-unique specs.

* `pivot_longer()` automatically disambiguates non-unique ouputs, which can
  occur when the input variables include some additional component that you
  don't care about and want to discard (#792, #793).
  
    ```{r}
    df <- tibble(id = 1:3, x_1 = 1:3, x_2 = 4:6)  
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_pattern = "(.)_.")
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_sep = "_", names_to = c("name", NA))
    df %>% pivot_longer(-id, names_sep = "_", names_to = c(".value", NA))
    ```
    
* `pivot_wider()` gains a `names_sort` argument which allows you to sort
  column names in order. The default, `FALSE`, orders columms by their 
  first appearance (#839). In a future version, I'll consider changing the
  default to `TRUE`.

* `pivot_wider()` gains a `names_glue` argument that allows you to construct
  output column names with a glue specification.

* `pivot_wider()` arguments `values_fn` and `values_fill` can now be single 
  values; you now only need to use a named list if you want to use different 
  values for different value columns (#739, #746). They also get improved 
  errors if they're not of the expected type.

## Rectangling

* `hoist()` now automatically names pluckers that are a single string (#837).
  It error if you use duplicated column names (@mgirlich, #834), and now uses 
  `rlang::list2()` behind the scenes (which means that you can now use `!!!` 
  and `:=`) (#801).

* `unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`, and `hoist()` do a better job 
  simplifying list-cols. They no longer add unneeded `unspecified()` when
  the result is still a list (#806), and work when the list contains 
  non-vectors (#810, #848).

* `unnest_wider(names_sep = "")` now provides default names for unnamed inputs,
  suppressing the many previous name repair messages (#742).

## Nesting

* `pack()` and `nest()` gains a `.names_sep` argument allows you to strip outer 
  names from inner names, in symmetrical way to how the same argument to 
  `unpack()` and `unnest()` combines inner and outer names (#795, #797).

* `unnest_wider()` and `unnest_longer()` can now unnest `list_of` columns. This
  is important for unnesting columns created from `nest()` and with 
  `pivot_wider()`, which will create `list_of` columns if the id columns are 
  non-unique (#741).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `chop()` now creates list-columns of class `vctrs::list_of()`. This helps 
  keep track of the type in case the chopped data frame is empty, allowing 
  `unchop()` to reconstitute a data frame with the correct number and types
  of column even when there are no observations.

* `drop_na()` now preserves attributes of unclassed vectors (#905).

* `expand()`, `expand_grid()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` once again 
  evaluate their inputs iteratively, so you can refer to freshly created 
  columns, e.g. `crossing(x = seq(-2, 2), y = x)` (#820).

* `expand()`, `expand_grid()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` gain a 
  `.name_repair` giving you control over their name repair strategy 
  (@jeffreypullin, #798).

* `extract()` lets you use `NA` in `into`, as documented (#793).

* `extract()`, `separate()`, `hoist()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `unnest_wider()`
  give a better error message if `col` is missing (#805).

* `pack()`'s first argument is now `.data` instead of `data` (#759).

* `pivot_longer()` now errors if `values_to` is not a length-1 character vector 
  (#949).

* `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` are now generic so implementations
  can be provided for objects other than data frames (#800).

* `pivot_wider()` can now pivot data frame columns (#926)

* `unite(na.rm = TRUE)` now works for all types of variable, not just character 
  vectors (#765).

* `unnest_wider()` gives a better error message if you attempt to unnest
  multiple columns (#740).

* `unnest_auto()` works when the input data contains a column called `col` 
  (#959).

# tidyr 1.0.2

* Minor fixes for dev versions of rlang, tidyselect, and tibble.

# tidyr 1.0.1

* Did not exist since I accidentally released v1.0.2

# tidyr 1.0.0

## Breaking changes

See `vignette("in-packages")` for a detailed transition guide.

* `nest()` and `unnest()` have new syntax. The majority of existing usage 
  should be automatically translated to the new syntax with a warning. 
  If that doesn't work, put this in your script to use the old versions
  until you can take a closer look and update your code:

  ```r
  library(tidyr)
  nest <- nest_legacy
  unnest <- unnest_legacy
  ```

* `nest()` now preserves grouping, which has implications for downstream calls
  to group-aware functions, such as `dplyr::mutate()` and `filter()`.

* The first argument of `nest()` has changed from `data` to `.data`.

* `unnest()` uses the [emerging tidyverse standard](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/01/tibble-2.0.1/#name-repair)
  to disambiguate unique names. Use `names_repair = tidyr_legacy` to 
  request the previous approach.

* `unnest_()`/`nest_()` and the lazyeval methods for `unnest()`/`nest()` are 
  now defunct. They have been deprecated for some time, and, since the interface
  has changed, package authors will need to update to avoid deprecation
  warnings. I think one clean break should be less work for everyone.
  
    All other lazyeval functions have been formally deprecated, and will be
    made defunct in the next major release. (See [lifecycle vignette](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/lifecycle.html) for 
    details on deprecation stages).

* `crossing()` and `nesting()` now return 0-row outputs if any input is a 
  length-0 vector. If you want to preserve the previous behaviour which 
  silently dropped these inputs, you should convert empty vectors to `NULL`.
  (More discussion on this general pattern at 
  https://github.com/tidyverse/principles/issues/24)

## Pivoting

New `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` provide modern alternatives to `spread()` and `gather()`. They have been carefully redesigned to be easier to learn and remember, and include many new features. Learn more in `vignette("pivot")`.
    
These functions resolve multiple existing issues with `spread()`/`gather()`. Both functions now handle mulitple value columns (#149/#150), support more vector types (#333), use tidyverse conventions for duplicated column names (#496, #478), and are symmetric (#453). `pivot_longer()` gracefully handles duplicated column names (#472), and can directly split column names into multiple variables. `pivot_wider()` can now aggregate (#474), select keys (#572), and has control over generated column names (#208).
  
To demonstrate how these functions work in practice, tidyr has gained several new datasets: `relig_income`, `construction`, `billboard`, `us_rent_income`, `fish_encounters` and `world_bank_pop`.

Finally, tidyr demos have been removed. They are dated, and have been superseded by `vignette("pivot")`.

## Rectangling

tidyr contains four new functions to support **rectangling**, turning a deeply nested list into a tidy tibble: `unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`, `unnest_auto()`, and `hoist()`. They are documented in a new vignette: `vignette("rectangle")`.

`unnest_longer()` and `unnest_wider()` make it easier to unnest list-columns of vectors into either rows or columns (#418). `unnest_auto()` automatically picks between `_longer()` and `_wider()` using heuristics based on the presence of common names.
  
New `hoist()` provides a convenient way of plucking components of a list-column out into their own top-level columns (#341). This is particularly useful when you are working with deeply nested JSON, because it provides a convenient shortcut for the `mutate()` + `map()` pattern:
  
```{r}
df %>% hoist(metadata, name = "name")
# shortcut for
df %>% mutate(name = map_chr(metadata, "name"))
```

## Nesting

`nest()` and `unnest()` have been updated with new interfaces that are more closely aligned to evolving tidyverse conventions. They use the theory developed in [vctrs](https://vctrs.r-lib.org) to more consistently handle mixtures of input types, and their arguments have been overhauled based on the last few years of experience. They are supported by a new `vignette("nest")`, which outlines some of the main ideas of nested data (it's still very rough, but will get better over time).
  
The biggest change is to their operation with multiple columns: `df %>% unnest(x, y, z)` becomes `df %>% unnest(c(x, y, z))` and `df %>% nest(x, y, z)` becomes `df %>% nest(data = c(x, y, z))`.
  
I have done my best to ensure that common uses of `nest()` and `unnest()` will continue to work, generating an informative warning telling you precisely how you need to update your code. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/new) if I've missed an important use case.

`unnest()` has been overhauled:

* New `keep_empty` parameter ensures that every row in the input gets
  at least one row in the output, inserting missing values as needed (#358).

* Provides `names_sep` argument to control how inner and outer column names
  are combined.
  
* Uses standard tidyverse name-repair rules, so by default you will get an
  error if the output would contain multiple columns with the same name. You
  can override by using `name_repair` (#514).
  
* Now supports `NULL` entries (#436). 

## Packing and chopping

Under the hood, `nest()` and `unnest()` are implemented with `chop()`, `pack()`, `unchop()`, and `unpack()`:

* `pack()` and `unpack()` allow you to pack and unpack columns into
  data frame columns (#523). 
  
* `chop()` and `unchop()` chop up rows into sets of list-columns. 

Packing and chopping are interesting primarily because they are the atomic operations underlying nesting (and similarly, unchop and unpacking underlie unnesting), and I don't expect them to be used directly very often.

## New features

* New `expand_grid()`, a tidy version of `expand.grid()`, is lower-level than 
  the existing `expand()` and `crossing()` functions, as it takes individual
  vectors, and does not sort or uniquify them.

* `crossing()`, `nesting()`, and `expand()` have been rewritten to use 
  the vctrs package. This should not affect much existing code, but
  considerably simplies the implementation and ensures that these functions 
  work consistently across all generalised vectors (#557). As part of this
  alignment, these functions now only drop `NULL` inputs, not any 0-length
  vector.

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `full_seq()` now also works when gaps between observations are shorter than 
  the given `period`, but are within the tolerance given by `tol`. Previously, 
  gaps between consecutive observations had to be in the range [`period`, 
  `period + tol`]; gaps can now be in the range [`period - tol`, `period + tol`]
  (@ha0ye, #657).

* tidyr now re-exports `tibble()`, `as_tibble()`, and `tribble()`, 
  as well as the tidyselect helpers (`starts_with()`, `ends_width()`, ...).
  This makes generating documentation, reprexes, and tests easier, and
  makes tidyr easier to use without also attaching dplyr.

* All functions that take `...` have been instrumented with functions from
  the [ellipsis](https://github.com/r-lib/ellipsis/) package to warn if 
  you've supplied arguments that are ignored (typically because you've 
  misspelled an argument name) (#573).

* `complete()` now uses `full_join()` so that all levels are preserved even
  when not all levels are specified (@Ryo-N7, #493).

* `crossing()` now takes the unique values of data frame inputs, not just
  vector inputs (#490).

* `gather()` throws an error if a column is a data frame (#553).

* `extract()` (and hence `pivot_longer()`) can extract multiple input values
  into a single output column (#619).
  
* `fill()` is now implemented using `dplyr::mutate_at()`. This radically 
  simplifies the implementation and considerably improves performance when 
  working with grouped data (#520).  
  
* `fill()` now accepts `downup` and `updown` as fill directions
  (@coolbutuseless, #505).

* `unite()` gains `na.rm` argument, making it easier to remove missing values
  prior to uniting values together (#203)

# tidyr 0.8.3

* `crossing()` preserves factor levels (#410), now works with list-columns 
  (#446, @SamanthaToet). (These also help `expand()` which is built on top
  of `crossing()`)

* `nest()` is compatible with dplyr 0.8.0.

* `spread()` works when the id variable has names (#525).

* `unnest()` preserves column being unnested when input is zero-length (#483),
  using `list_of()` attribute to correctly restore columns, where possible.

* `unnest()` will run with named and unnamed list-columns of same length
  (@hlendway, #460).

# tidyr 0.8.2

* `separate()` now accepts `NA` as a column name in the `into` argument to
  denote columns which are omitted from the result. (@markdly, #397).

* Minor updates to ensure compatibility with dependencies.

# tidyr 0.8.1

* `unnest()` weakens test of "atomicity" to restore previous behaviour when
  unnesting factors and dates (#407).

# tidyr 0.8.0

## Breaking changes

* There are no deliberate breaking changes in this release. However, a number 
  of packages are failing with errors related to numbers of elements in columns, 
  and row names. It is possible that these are accidental API changes or new 
  bugs. If you see such an error in your package, I would sincerely appreciate
  a minimal reprex.

* `separate()` now correctly uses -1 to refer to the far right position, 
  instead of -2. If you depended on this behaviour, you'll need to switch
  on `packageVersion("tidyr") > "0.7.2"`

## New features

* Increased test coverage from 84% to 99%.

* `uncount()` performs the inverse operation of `dplyr::count()` (#279)

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `complete(data)` now returns `data` rather than throwing an error (#390).
  `complete()` with zero-length completions returns original input (#331).

* `crossing()` preserves `NA`s (#364).

* `expand()` with empty input gives empty data frame instead of `NULL` (#331).

* `expand()`, `crossing()`, and `complete()` now complete empty factors instead 
  of dropping them (#270, #285)

* `extract()` has a better error message if `regex` does not contain the
  expected number of groups (#313).

* `drop_na()` no longer drops columns (@jennybryan, #245), and works with 
  list-cols (#280). Equivalent of `NA` in a list column is any empty 
  (length 0) data structure.

* `nest()` is now faster, especially when a long data frame is collapsed into 
  a nested data frame with few rows.

* `nest()` on a zero-row data frame works as expected (#320).

* `replace_na()` no longer complains if you try and replace missing values in
  variables not present in the data (#356).

* `replace_na()` now also works with vectors (#342, @flying-sheep), and
  can replace `NULL` in list-columns. It throws a better error message if
  you attempt to replace with something other than length 1.

* `separate()` no longer checks that `...` is empty, allowing methods to make
  use of it. This check was added in tidyr 0.4.0 (2016-02-02) to deprecate
  previous behaviour where `...` was passed to `strsplit()`.

* `separate()` and `extract()` now insert columns in correct position when
  `drop = TRUE` (#394).

* `separate()` now works correctly counts from RHS when using negative
  integer `sep` values (@markdly, #315).

* `separate()` gets improved warning message when pieces aren't as expected
  (#375).

* `separate_rows()` supports list columns (#321), and works with empty tibbles.

* `spread()` now consistently returns 0 row outputs for 0 row inputs (#269).

* `spread()` now works when `key` column includes `NA` and `drop` is `FALSE` 
  (#254).

* `spread()` no longer returns tibbles with row names (#322).

* `spread()`, `separate()`, `extract()` (#255), and `gather()` (#347) now 
  replace existing variables rather than creating an invalid data frame with 
  duplicated variable names (matching the semantics of mutate).

* `unite()` now works (as documented) if you don't supply any variables (#355).

* `unnest()` gains `preserve` argument which allows you to preserve list
  columns without unnesting them (#328).

* `unnest()` can unnested list-columns contains lists of lists (#278).

* `unnest(df)` now works if `df` contains no list-cols (#344)

# tidyr 0.7.2

* The SE variants `gather_()`, `spread_()` and `nest_()` now
  treat non-syntactic names in the same way as pre tidy eval versions
  of tidyr (#361).
  
* Fix tidyr bug revealed by R-devel.

# tidyr 0.7.1

This is a hotfix release to account for some tidyselect changes in the
unit tests.

Note that the upcoming version of tidyselect backtracks on some of the
changes announced for 0.7.0. The special evaluation semantics for
selection have been changed back to the old behaviour because the new
rules were causing too much trouble and confusion. From now on data
expressions (symbols and calls to `:` and `c()`) can refer to both
registered variables and to objects from the context.

However the semantics for context expressions (any calls other than to
`:` and `c()`) remain the same. Those expressions are evaluated in the
context only and cannot refer to registered variables. If you're
writing functions and refer to contextual objects, it is still a good
idea to avoid data expressions by following the advice of the 0.7.0
release notes.

# tidyr 0.7.0

This release includes important changes to tidyr internals. Tidyr now
supports the new tidy evaluation framework for quoting (NSE)
functions. It also uses the new tidyselect package as selecting
backend.


## Breaking changes

- If you see error messages about objects or functions not found, it
  is likely because the selecting functions are now stricter in their
  arguments An example of selecting function is `gather()` and its
  `...` argument. This change makes the code more robust by
  disallowing ambiguous scoping. Consider the following code:

  ```
  x <- 3
  df <- tibble(w = 1, x = 2, y = 3)
  gather(df, "variable", "value", 1:x)
  ```

  Does it select the first three columns (using the `x` defined in the
  global environment), or does it select the first two columns (using
  the column named `x`)?

  To solve this ambiguity, we now make a strict distinction between
  data and context expressions. A data expression is either a bare
  name or an expression like `x:y` or `c(x, y)`. In a data expression,
  you can only refer to columns from the data frame. Everything else
  is a context expression in which you can only refer to objects that
  you have defined with `<-`.

  In practice this means that you can no longer refer to contextual
  objects like this:

  ```
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, 1:ncol(mtcars))

  x <- 3
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, 1:x)
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, -(1:x))
  ```

  You now have to be explicit about where to find objects. To do so,
  you can use the quasiquotation operator `!!` which will evaluate its
  argument early and inline the result:

  ```{r}
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! 1:ncol(mtcars))
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! 1:x)
  mtcars %>% gather(var, value, !! -(1:x))
  ```

  An alternative is to turn your data expression into a context
  expression by using `seq()` or `seq_len()` instead of `:`. See the
  section on tidyselect for more information about these semantics.

- Following the switch to tidy evaluation, you might see warnings
  about the "variable context not set". This is most likely caused by
  supplyng helpers like `everything()` to underscored versions of
  tidyr verbs. Helpers should be always be evaluated lazily. To fix
  this, just quote the helper with a formula: `drop_na(df,
  ~everything())`.

- The selecting functions are now stricter when you supply integer
  positions. If you see an error along the lines of

  ```
  `-0.949999999999999`, `-0.940000000000001`, ... must resolve to
  integer column positions, not a double vector
  ```

  please round the positions before supplying them to tidyr. Double
  vectors are fine as long as they are rounded.


## Switch to tidy evaluation

tidyr is now a tidy evaluation grammar. See the
[programming vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html)
in dplyr for practical information about tidy evaluation.

The tidyr port is a bit special. While the philosophy of tidy
evaluation is that R code should refer to real objects (from the data
frame or from the context), we had to make some exceptions to this
rule for tidyr. The reason is that several functions accept bare
symbols to specify the names of _new_ columns to create (`gather()`
being a prime example). This is not tidy because the symbol do not
represent any actual object. Our workaround is to capture these
arguments using `rlang::quo_name()` (so they still support
quasiquotation and you can unquote symbols or strings). This type of
NSE is now discouraged in the tidyverse: symbols in R code should
represent real objects.

Following the switch to tidy eval the underscored variants are softly
deprecated. However they will remain around for some time and without
warning for backward compatibility.


## Switch to the tidyselect backend

The selecting backend of dplyr has been extracted in a standalone
package tidyselect which tidyr now uses for selecting variables. It is
used for selecting multiple variables (in `drop_na()`) as well as
single variables (the `col` argument of `extract()` and `separate()`,
and the `key` and `value` arguments of `spread()`). This implies the
following changes:

* The arguments for selecting a single variable now support all
  features from `dplyr::pull()`. You can supply a name or a position,
  including negative positions.

* Multiple variables are now selected a bit differently. We now make a
  strict distinction between data and context expressions. A data
  expression is either a bare name of an expression like `x:y` or
  `c(x, y)`. In a data expression, you can only refer to columns from
  the data frame. Everything else is a context expression in which you
  can only refer to objects that you have defined with `<-`.

  You can still refer to contextual objects in a data expression by
  being explicit. One way of being explicit is to unquote a variable
  from the environment with the tidy eval operator `!!`:

  ```r
  x <- 2
  drop_na(df, 2)     # Works fine
  drop_na(df, x)     # Object 'x' not found
  drop_na(df, !! x)  # Works as if you had supplied 2
  ```

  On the other hand, select helpers like `start_with()` are context
  expressions. It is therefore easy to refer to objects and they will
  never be ambiguous with data columns:

  ```{r}
  x <- "d"
  drop_na(df, starts_with(x))
  ```

  While these special rules is in contrast to most dplyr and tidyr
  verbs (where both the data and the context are in scope) they make
  sense for selecting functions and should provide more robust and
  helpful semantics.

# tidyr 0.6.3

* Patch tests to be compatible with dev tibble


# tidyr 0.6.2

* Register C functions

* Added package docs

* Patch tests to be compatible with dev dplyr.


# tidyr 0.6.1

* Patch test to be compatible with dev tibble

* Changed deprecation message of `extract_numeric()` to point to 
  `readr::parse_number()` rather than `readr::parse_numeric()`


# tidyr 0.6.0

## API changes

* `drop_na()` removes observations which have `NA` in the given variables. If no
  variables are given, all variables are considered (#194, @janschulz).

* `extract_numeric()` has been deprecated (#213).

* Renamed `table4` and `table5` to `table4a` and `table4b` to make their
  connection more clear. The `key` and `value` variables in `table2` have 
  been renamed to `type` and `count`.

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `expand()`, `crossing()`, and `nesting()` now silently drop zero-length
  inputs.
  
* `crossing_()` and `nesting_()` are versions of `crossing()` and `nesting()`
  that take a list as input.

* `full_seq()` works correctly for dates and date/times.

# tidyr 0.5.1

* Restored compatibility with R < 3.3.0 by avoiding `getS3method(envir = )` (#205, @krlmlr).

# tidyr 0.5.0

## New functions

* `separate_rows()` separates observations with multiple delimited values into
  separate rows (#69, @aaronwolen).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `complete()` preserves grouping created by dplyr (#168).

* `expand()` (and hence `complete()`) preserves the ordered attribute of 
  factors (#165).

* `full_seq()` preserve attributes for dates and date/times (#156),
  and sequences no longer need to start at 0.

* `gather()` can now gather together list columns (#175), and 
  `gather_.data.frame(na.rm = TRUE)` now only removes missing values
  if they're actually present (#173).

* `nest()` returns correct output if every variable is nested (#186).

* `separate()` fills from right-to-left (not left-to-right!) when fill = "left"
  (#170, @dgrtwo).
  
* `separate()` and `unite()` now automatically drop removed variables from
  grouping (#159, #177).

* `spread()` gains a `sep` argument. If not-null, this will name columns
  as "key<sep>value". Additionally, if sep is `NULL` missing values will be
  converted to `<NA>` (#68).

* `spread()` works in the presence of list-columns (#199)

* `unnest()` works with non-syntactic names (#190).

* `unnest()` gains a `sep` argument. If non-null, this will rename the 
  columns of nested data frames to include both the original column name,
  and the nested column name, separated by `.sep` (#184).

* `unnest()` gains `.id` argument that works the same way as `bind_rows()`.
  This is useful if you have a named list of data frames or vectors (#125).

* Moved in useful sample datasets from the DSR package.

* Made compatible with both dplyr 0.4 and 0.5.

* tidyr functions that create new columns are more aggresive about re-encoding
  the column names as UTF-8. 

# tidyr 0.4.1

* Fixed bug in `nest()` where nested data was ending up in the wrong row (#158).

# tidyr 0.4.0

## Nested data frames

`nest()` and `unnest()` have been overhauled to support a useful way of structuring data frames: the __nested__ data frame. In a grouped data frame, you have one row per observation, and additional metadata define the groups. In a nested data frame, you have one __row__ per group, and the individual observations are stored in a column that is a list of data frames. This is a useful structure when you have lists of other objects (like models) with one element per group.

* `nest()` now produces a single list of data frames called "data" rather
  than a list column for each variable. Nesting variables are not included
  in nested data frames. It also works with grouped data frames made
  by `dplyr::group_by()`. You can override the default column name with `.key`.

* `unnest()` gains a `.drop` argument which controls what happens to
  other list columns. By default, they're kept if the output doesn't require
  row duplication; otherwise they're dropped.
  
* `unnest()` now has `mutate()` semantics for `...` - this allows you to
  unnest transformed columns more easily. (Previously it used select semantics).

## Expanding

* `expand()` once again allows you to evaluate arbitrary expressions like
  `full_seq(year)`. If you were previously using `c()` to created nested 
  combinations, you'll now need to use `nesting()` (#85, #121).

* `nesting()` and `crossing()` allow you to create nested and crossed data
  frames from individual vectors. `crossing()` is similar to 
  `base::expand.grid()`

* `full_seq(x, period)` creates the full sequence of values from `min(x)` to
  `max(x)` every `period` values.

## Minor bug fixes and improvements

* `fill()` fills in `NULL`s in list-columns.

* `fill()` gains a direction argument so that it can fill either upwards or 
  downwards (#114).

* `gather()` now stores the key column as character, by default. To revert to
  the previous behaviour of using a factor (which allows you to preserve the
  ordering of the columns), use `key_factor = TRUE` (#96).

* All tidyr verbs do the right thing for grouped data frames created by 
  `group_by()` (#122, #129, #81).

* `seq_range()` has been removed. It was never used or announced.

* `spread()` once again creates columns of mixed type when `convert = TRUE` 
  (#118, @jennybc). `spread()` with `drop = FALSE`  handles zero-length 
  factors (#56). `spread()`ing a data frame with only key and value columns 
  creates a one row output (#41).

* `unite()` now removes old columns before adding new (#89, @krlmlr).

* `separate()` now warns if defunct ... argument is used (#151, @krlmlr).

# tidyr 0.3.1

* Fixed bug where attributes of non-gather columns were lost (#104)

# tidyr 0.3.0

## New features

* New `complete()` provides a wrapper around `expand()`, `left_join()` and 
  `replace_na()` for a common task: completing a data frame with missing
  combinations of variables.

* `fill()` fills in missing values in a column with the last non-missing 
  value (#4).

* New `replace_na()` makes it easy to replace missing values with something
  meaningful for your data.

* `nest()` is the complement of `unnest()` (#3).

* `unnest()` can now work with multiple list-columns at the same time. 
  If you don't supply any columns names, it will unlist all 
  list-columns (#44). `unnest()` can also handle columns that are
  lists of data frames (#58).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* tidyr no longer depends on reshape2. This should fix issues if you also
  try to load reshape (#88).

* `%>%` is re-exported from magrittr.

* `expand()` now supports nesting and crossing (see examples for details).
  This comes at the expense of creating new variables inline (#46).

* `expand_` does SE evaluation correctly so you can pass it a character vector
  of columns names (or list of formulas etc) (#70).

* `extract()` is 10x faster because it now uses stringi instead of 
  base R regular expressions. It also returns NA instead of throwing
  an error if the regular expression doesn't match (#72).
  
* `extract()` and `separate()` preserve character vectors when
  `convert` is TRUE (#99).
  
* The internals of `spread()` have been rewritten, and now preserve all 
  attributes of the input `value` column. This means that you can now 
  spread date (#62) and factor (#35) inputs.

* `spread()` gives a more informative error message if `key` or `value` don't
  exist in the input data (#36).

* `separate()` only displays the first 20 failures (#50). It has 
  finer control over what happens if there are two few matches:
  you can fill with missing values on either the "left" or the "right" (#49).
  `separate()` no longer throws an error if the number of pieces aren't
  as expected - instead it uses drops extra values and fills on the right
  and gives a warning.

* If the input is NA `separate()` and `extract()` both return silently
  return NA outputs, rather than throwing an error. (#77)

* Experimental `unnest()` method for lists has been removed.

# tidyr 0.2.0

## New functions

* Experimental `expand()` function (#21).

* Experiment `unnest()` function for converting named lists into
  data frames. (#3, #22)

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `extract_numeric()` preserves negative signs (#20).

* `gather()` has better defaults if `key` and `value` are not supplied.
  If `...` is ommitted, `gather()` selects all columns (#28). Performance
  is now comparable to `reshape2::melt()` (#18).

* `separate()` gains `extra` argument which lets you control what happens
  to extra pieces. The default is to throw an "error", but you can also
  "merge" or "drop".

* `spread()` gains `drop` argument, which allows you to preserve missing
  factor levels (#25). It converts factor value variables to character vectors, 
  instead of embedding a matrix inside the data frame (#35).

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Rectangling</h1>



<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Rectangling is the art and craft of taking a deeply nested list (often sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data set of rows and columns. There are three functions from tidyr that are particularly useful for rectangling:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unnest_longer()</code> takes each element of a list-column and makes a new row.</li>
<li><code>unnest_wider()</code> takes each element of a list-column and makes a new column.</li>
<li><code>unnest_auto()</code> guesses whether you want <code>unnest_longer()</code> or <code>unnest_wider()</code>.</li>
<li><code>hoist()</code> is similar to <code>unnest_wider()</code> but only plucks out selected components, and can reach down multiple levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very large number of data rectangling problems can be solved by combining these functions with a splash of dplyr (largely eliminating prior approaches that combined <code>mutate()</code> with multiple <code>purrr::map()</code>s).</p>
<p>To illustrate these techniques, well use the repurrrsive package, which provides a number deeply nested lists originally mostly captured from web APIs.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tidyr)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(dplyr)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(repurrrsive)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="github-users" class="section level2">
<h2>GitHub users</h2>
<p>Well start with <code>gh_users</code>, a list which contains information about six GitHub users. To begin, we put the <code>gh_users</code> list into a data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>users <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">tibble</span>(<span class="at">user =</span> gh_users)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This seems a bit counter-intuitive: why is the first step in making a list simpler to make it more complicated? But a data frame has a big advantage: it bundles together multiple vectors so that everything is tracked together in a single object.</p>
<p>Each <code>user</code> is a named list, where each element represents a column.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">names</span>(users<span class="sc">$</span>user[[<span class="dv">1</span>]])</span>

<p>There are two ways to turn the list components into columns. <code>unnest_wider()</code> takes every component and makes a new column:</p>

<p>But in this case, there are many components and we dont need most of them so we can instead use <code>hoist()</code>. <code>hoist()</code> allows us to pull out selected components using the same syntax as <code>purrr::pluck()</code>:</p>

<p><code>hoist()</code> removes the named components from the <code>user</code> list-column, so you can think of it as moving components out of the inner list into the top-level data frame.</p>

<p>Note the use of <code>c(&quot;owner&quot;, &quot;login&quot;)</code>: this allows us to reach two levels deep inside of a list. An alternative approach would be to pull out just <code>owner</code> and then put each element of it in a column:</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the list and carefully thinking about whether it needs to become rows or columns, you can use <code>unnest_auto()</code>. It uses a handful of heuristics to figure out whether <code>unnest_longer()</code> or <code>unnest_wider()</code> is appropriate, and tells you about its reasoning.</p>

<p>(Note that the empty titles (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>) are due to an infelicity in the input <code>got_chars</code>: ideally people without titles would have a title vector of length 0, not a title vector of length 1 containing an empty string.)</p>
<p>Again, we could rewrite using <code>unnest_auto()</code>. This is convenient for exploration, but I wouldnt rely on it in the long term - <code>unnest_auto()</code> has the undesirable property that it will always succeed. That means if your data structure changes, <code>unnest_auto()</code> will continue to work, but might give very different output that causes cryptic failures from downstream functions.</p>

<h2>Geocoding with google</h2>
<p>Next well tackle a more complex form of data that comes from Googles geocoding service. Its against the terms of service to cache this data, so I first write a very simple wrapper around the API. This relies on having an Google maps API key stored in an environment; if thats not available these code chunks wont be run.</p>

<p>The list that this function returns is quite complex:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>houston <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">geocode</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Houston TX&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">str</span>(houston)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Fortunately, we can attack the problem step by step with tidyr functions. To make the problem a bit harder (!) and more realistic, Ill start by geocoding a few cities:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>city <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Houston&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;LA&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;New York&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Chicago&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Springfield&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><a href="#cb18-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>city_geo <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> purrr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">map</span>(city, geocode)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ill put these results in a tibble, next to the original city name:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">tibble</span>(<span class="at">city =</span> city, <span class="at">json =</span> city_geo)</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first level contains components <code>status</code> and <code>result</code>, which we can reveal with <code>unnest_wider()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">unnest_wider</span>(json)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that <code>results</code> is a list of lists. Most of the cities have 1 element (representing a unique match from the geocoding API), but Springfield has two. We can pull these out into separate rows with <code>unnest_longer()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<span id="cb21-3"><a href="#cb21-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">unnest_longer</span>(results)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now these all have the same components, as revealed by <code>unnest_wider()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="#cb22-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<span id="cb22-4"><a href="#cb22-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">unnest_wider</span>(results)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can find the lat and lon coordinates by unnesting <code>geometry</code>:</p>

<span id="cb23-5"><a href="#cb23-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">unnest_wider</span>(geometry)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then location:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<span id="cb24-6"><a href="#cb24-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">unnest_wider</span>(location)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, <code>unnest_auto()</code> makes this simpler with the small risk of failing in unexpected ways if the input structure changes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>loc <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<h2>Data tidying</h2>
<p>It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And its not just a first step, but it must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. To get a handle on the problem, this paper focuses on a small, but important, aspect of data cleaning that I call data <strong>tidying</strong>: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.</p>
<p>The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. A standard makes initial data cleaning easier because you dont need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together. Current tools often require translation. You have to spend time munging the output from one tool so you can input it into another. Tidy datasets and tidy tools work hand in hand to make data analysis easier, allowing you to focus on the interesting domain problem, not on the uninteresting logistics of data.</p>

<h2>Defining tidy data</h2>

<p>Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning). In this section, Ill provide some standard vocabulary for describing the structure and semantics of a dataset, and then use those definitions to define tidy data.</p>
<div id="data-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Data structure</h3>
<p>Most statistical datasets are data frames made up of <strong>rows</strong> and <strong>columns</strong>. The columns are almost always labeled and the rows are sometimes labeled. The following code provides some data about an imaginary classroom in a format commonly seen in the wild. The table has three columns and four rows, and both rows and columns are labeled.</p>

<p>There are many ways to structure the same underlying data. The following table shows the same data as above, but the rows and columns have been transposed.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">read.csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;classroom2.csv&quot;</span>, <span class="at">stringsAsFactors =</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span>)</span>

<p>The data is the same, but the layout is different. Our vocabulary of rows and columns is simply not rich enough to describe why the two tables represent the same data. In addition to appearance, we need a way to describe the underlying semantics, or meaning, of the values displayed in the table.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-semantics" class="section level3">
<h3>Data semantics</h3>
<p>A dataset is a collection of <strong>values</strong>, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a <strong>variable</strong> and an <strong>observation</strong>. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.</p>
<p>A tidy version of the classroom data looks like this: (youll learn how the functions work a little later)</p>

<p>This makes the values, variables, and observations more clear. The dataset contains 36 values representing three variables and 12 observations. The variables are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>name</code>, with four possible values (Billy, Suzy, Lionel, and Jenny).</p></li>
<li><p><code>assessment</code>, with three possible values (quiz1, quiz2, and test1).</p></li>
<li><p><code>grade</code>, with five or six values depending on how you think of the missing value (A, B, C, D, F, NA).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The tidy data frame explicitly tells us the definition of an observation. In this classroom, every combination of <code>name</code> and <code>assessment</code> is a single measured observation. The dataset also informs us of missing values, which can and do have meaning. Billy was absent for the first quiz, but tried to salvage his grade. Suzy failed the first quiz, so she decided to drop the class. To calculate Billys final grade, we might replace this missing value with an F (or he might get a second chance to take the quiz). However, if we want to know the class average for Test 1, dropping Suzys structural missing value would be more appropriate than imputing a new value.</p>
<p>For a given dataset, its usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general. For example, if the columns in the classroom data were <code>height</code> and <code>weight</code> we would have been happy to call them variables. If the columns were <code>height</code> and <code>width</code>, it would be less clear cut, as we might think of height and width as values of a <code>dimension</code> variable. If the columns were <code>home phone</code> and <code>work phone</code>, we could treat these as two variables, but in a fraud detection environment we might want variables <code>phone number</code> and <code>number type</code> because the use of one phone number for multiple people might suggest fraud. A general rule of thumb is that it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., <code>z</code> is a linear combination of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, <code>density</code> is the ratio of <code>weight</code> to <code>volume</code>) than between rows, and it is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g., average of group a vs.average of group b) than between groups of columns.</p>
<p>In a given analysis, there may be multiple levels of observation. For example, in a trial of new allergy medication we might have three observational types: demographic data collected from each person (<code>age</code>, <code>sex</code>, <code>race</code>), medical data collected from each person on each day (<code>number of sneezes</code>, <code>redness of eyes</code>), and meteorological data collected on each day (<code>temperature</code>, <code>pollen count</code>).</p>
<p>Variables may change over the course of analysis. Often the variables in the raw data are very fine grained, and may add extra modelling complexity for little explanatory gain. For example, many surveys ask variations on the same question to better get at an underlying trait. In early stages of analysis, variables correspond to questions. In later stages, you change focus to traits, computed by averaging together multiple questions. This considerably simplifies analysis because you dont need a hierarchical model, and you can often pretend that the data is continuous, not discrete.</p>

<div id="tidy-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidy data</h3>
<p>Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In <strong>tidy data</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Every column is a variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Every row is an observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Every cell is a single value.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is Codds 3rd normal form, but with the constraints framed in statistical language, and the focus put on a single dataset rather than the many connected datasets common in relational databases. <strong>Messy data</strong> is any other arrangement of the data.</p>
<p>Tidy data makes it easy for an analyst or a computer to extract needed variables because it provides a standard way of structuring a dataset. Compare the different versions of the classroom data: in the messy version you need to use different strategies to extract different variables. This slows analysis and invites errors. If you consider how many data analysis operations involve all of the values in a variable (every aggregation function), you can see how important it is to extract these values in a simple, standard way. Tidy data is particularly well suited for vectorised programming languages like R, because the layout ensures that values of different variables from the same observation are always paired.</p>
<p>While the order of variables and observations does not affect analysis, a good ordering makes it easier to scan the raw values. One way of organising variables is by their role in the analysis: are values fixed by the design of the data collection, or are they measured during the course of the experiment? Fixed variables describe the experimental design and are known in advance. Computer scientists often call fixed variables dimensions, and statisticians usually denote them with subscripts on random variables. Measured variables are what we actually measure in the study. Fixed variables should come first, followed by measured variables, each ordered so that related variables are contiguous. Rows can then be ordered by the first variable, breaking ties with the second and subsequent (fixed) variables. This is the convention adopted by all tabular displays in this paper.</p>

<h2>Tidying messy datasets</h2>
<p>Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three precepts of tidy data in almost every way imaginable. While occasionally you do get a dataset that you can start analysing immediately, this is the exception, not the rule. This section describes the five most common problems with messy datasets, along with their remedies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Column headers are values, not variable names.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple variables are stored in one column.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables are stored in both rows and columns.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.</p></li>
<li><p>A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, most messy datasets, including types of messiness not explicitly described above, can be tidied with a small set of tools: pivoting (longer and wider) and separating. The following sections illustrate each problem with a real dataset that I have encountered, and show how to tidy them.</p>
<div id="column-headers-are-values-not-variable-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Column headers are values, not variable names</h3>
<p>A common type of messy dataset is tabular data designed for presentation, where variables form both the rows and columns, and column headers are values, not variable names. While I would call this arrangement messy, in some cases it can be extremely useful. It provides efficient storage for completely crossed designs, and it can lead to extremely efficient computation if desired operations can be expressed as matrix operations.</p>
<p>The following code shows a subset of a typical dataset of this form. This dataset explores the relationship between income and religion in the US. It comes from a report produced by the Pew Research Center, an American think-tank that collects data on attitudes to topics ranging from religion to the internet, and produces many reports that contain datasets in this format.</p>

<p>This dataset has three variables, <code>religion</code>, <code>income</code> and <code>frequency</code>. To tidy it, we need to <strong>pivot</strong> the non-variable columns into a two-column key-value pair. This action is often described as making a wide dataset longer (or taller).</p>
<p>When pivoting variables, we need to provide the name of the new key-value columns to create. After defining the colums to pivot (every column except for religion), you will need the name of the key column, which is the name of the variable defined by the values of the column headings. In this case, its <code>income</code>. The second argument is the name of the value column, <code>frequency</code>.</p>

<p>This form is tidy because each column represents a variable and each row represents an observation, in this case a demographic unit corresponding to a combination of <code>religion</code> and <code>income</code>.</p>
<p>This format is also used to record regularly spaced observations over time. For example, the Billboard dataset shown below records the date a song first entered the billboard top 100. It has variables for <code>artist</code>, <code>track</code>, <code>date.entered</code>, <code>rank</code> and <code>week</code>. The rank in each week after it enters the top 100 is recorded in 75 columns, <code>wk1</code> to <code>wk75</code>. This form of storage is not tidy, but it is useful for data entry. It reduces duplication since otherwise each song in each week would need its own row, and song metadata like title and artist would need to be repeated. This will be discussed in more depth in <a href="#multiple-types">multiple types</a>.</p>

<p>To tidy this dataset, we first use <code>pivot_longer()</code> to make the dataset longer. We transform the columns from <code>wk1</code> to <code>wk76</code>, making a new column for their names, <code>week</code>, and a new value for their values, <code>rank</code>:</p>

<p>Here we use <code>values_drop_na = TRUE</code> to drop any missing values from the rank column. In this data, missing values represent weeks that the song wasnt in the charts, so can be safely dropped.</p>
<p>In this case its also nice to do a little cleaning, converting the week variable to a number, and figuring out the date corresponding to each week on the charts:</p>

<h3>Multiple variables stored in one column</h3>
<p>After pivoting columns, the key column is sometimes a combination of multiple underlying variable names. This happens in the <code>tb</code> (tuberculosis) dataset, shown below. This dataset comes from the World Health Organisation, and records the counts of confirmed tuberculosis cases by <code>country</code>, <code>year</code>, and demographic group. The demographic groups are broken down by <code>sex</code> (m, f) and <code>age</code> (0-14, 15-25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, unknown).</p>

<p>Column headers in this format are often separated by a non-alphanumeric character (e.g.<code>.</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>:</code>), or have a fixed width format, like in this dataset. <code>separate()</code> makes it easy to split a compound variables into individual variables. You can either pass it a regular expression to split on (the default is to split on non-alphanumeric columns), or a vector of character positions. In this case we want to split after the first character:</p>

<p>Storing the values in this form resolves a problem in the original data. We want to compare rates, not counts, which means we need to know the population. In the original format, there is no easy way to add a population variable. It has to be stored in a separate table, which makes it hard to correctly match populations to counts. In tidy form, adding variables for population and rate is easy because theyre just additional columns.</p>
<p>In this case, we could also do the transformation in a single step by supplying multiple column names to <code>names_to</code> and also supplying a grouped regular expression to <code>names_pattern</code>:</p>

<p>This dataset is mostly tidy, but the <code>element</code> column is not a variable; it stores the names of variables. (Not shown in this example are the other meteorological variables <code>prcp</code> (precipitation) and <code>snow</code> (snowfall)). Fixing this requires widening the data: <code>pivot_wider()</code> is inverse of <code>pivot_longer()</code>, pivoting <code>element</code> and <code>value</code> back out across multiple columns:</p>

<h3>Multiple types in one table</h3>
<p>Datasets often involve values collected at multiple levels, on different types of observational units. During tidying, each type of observational unit should be stored in its own table. This is closely related to the idea of database normalisation, where each fact is expressed in only one place. Its important because otherwise inconsistencies can arise.</p>
<p>The billboard dataset actually contains observations on two types of observational units: the song and its rank in each week. This manifests itself through the duplication of facts about the song: <code>artist</code> is repeated many times.</p>
<p>This dataset needs to be broken down into two pieces: a song dataset which stores <code>artist</code> and <code>song name</code>, and a ranking dataset which gives the <code>rank</code> of the <code>song</code> in each <code>week</code>. We first extract a <code>song</code> dataset:</p>

<p>You could also imagine a <code>week</code> dataset which would record background information about the week, maybe the total number of songs sold or similar demographic information.</p>
<p>Normalisation is useful for tidying and eliminating inconsistencies. However, there are few data analysis tools that work directly with relational data, so analysis usually also requires denormalisation or the merging the datasets back into one table.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-type-in-multiple-tables" class="section level3">
<h3>One type in multiple tables</h3>
<p>Its also common to find data values about a single type of observational unit spread out over multiple tables or files. These tables and files are often split up by another variable, so that each represents a single year, person, or location. As long as the format for individual records is consistent, this is an easy problem to fix:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Read the files into a list of tables.</p></li>
<li><p>For each table, add a new column that records the original file name (the file name is often the value of an important variable).</p></li>
<li><p>Combine all tables into a single table.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Purrr makes this straightforward in R. The following code generates a vector of file names in a directory (<code>data/</code>) which match a regular expression (ends in <code>.csv</code>). Next we name each element of the vector with the name of the file. We do this because will preserve the names in the following step, ensuring that each row in the final data frame is labeled with its source. Finally, <code>map_dfr()</code> loops over each path, reading in the csv file and combining the results into a single data frame.</p>

<p>Once you have a single table, you can perform additional tidying as needed. An example of this type of cleaning can be found at <a href="https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names" class="uri">https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names</a> which takes 129 yearly baby name tables provided by the US Social Security Administration and combines them into a single file.</p>
<p>A more complicated situation occurs when the dataset structure changes over time. For example, the datasets may contain different variables, the same variables with different names, different file formats, or different conventions for missing values. This may require you to tidy each file to individually (or, if youre lucky, in small groups) and then combine them once tidied. An example of this type of tidying is illustrated in <a href="https://github.com/hadley/data-fuel-economy" class="uri">https://github.com/hadley/data-fuel-economy</a>, which shows the tidying of <span>epa</span> fuel economy data for over 50,000 cars from 1978 to 2008. The raw data is available online, but each year is stored in a separate file and there are four major formats with many minor variations, making tidying this dataset a considerable challenge.</p>

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Programming with tidyr</h1>



<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most tidyr verbs use <strong>tidy evaluation</strong> to make interactive data exploration fast and fluid. Tidy evaluation is a special type of non-standard evaluation used throughout the tidyverse. Heres some typical tidyr code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tidyr)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>iris <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">nest</span>(<span class="at">data =</span> <span class="sc">!</span>Species)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; # A tibble: 3  2</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   Species    data             </span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;           </span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 1 setosa     &lt;tibble [50  4]&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 2 versicolor &lt;tibble [50  4]&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 3 virginica  &lt;tibble [50  4]&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tidy evaluation is why we can use <code>!Species</code> to say all the columns except <code>Species</code>, without having to quote the column name (<code>&quot;Species&quot;</code>) or refer to the enclosing data frame (<code>iris$Species</code>).</p>
<p>Two basic forms of tidy evaluation are used in tidyr:</p>

<li><p><strong>Tidy selection</strong>: <code>drop_na()</code>, <code>fill()</code>, <code>pivot_longer()</code>/<code>pivot_wider()</code>, <code>nest()</code>/<code>unnest()</code>, <code>separate()</code>/<code>extract()</code>, and <code>unite()</code> let you select variables based on position, name, or type (e.g.<code>1:3</code>, <code>starts_with(&quot;x&quot;)</code>, or <code>is.numeric</code>). Literally, you can use all the same techniques as with <code>dplyr::select()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data masking</strong>: <code>expand()</code>, <code>crossing()</code> and <code>nesting()</code> let you refer to use data variables as if they were variables in the environment (i.e.you write <code>my_variable</code> not <code>df$myvariable</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We focus on tidy selection here, since its the most common. You can learn more about data masking in the equivalent vignette in dplyr: <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/programming.html" class="uri">https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/programming.html</a>. For other considerations when writing tidyr code in packages, please see <code>vignette(&quot;in-packages&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>Weve pointed out that tidyrs tidy evaluation interface is optimized for interactive exploration. The flip side is that this adds some challenges to indirect use, i.e.when youre working inside a <code>for</code> loop or a function. This vignette shows you how to overcome those challenges. Well first go over the basics of tidy selection and data masking, talk about how to use them indirectly, and then show you a number of recipes to solve common problems.</p>
<p>Before we go on, we reveal the version of tidyr were using and make a small dataset to use in examples.</p>

<h2>Tidy selection</h2>
<p>Underneath all functions that use tidy selection is the <a href="https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/">tidyselect</a> package. It provides a miniature domain specific language that makes it easy to select columns by name, position, or type. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>select(df, 1)</code> selects the first column; <code>select(df, last_col())</code> selects the last column.</p></li>
<li><p><code>select(df, c(a, b, c))</code> selects columns <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>select(df, starts_with(&quot;a&quot;))</code> selects all columns whose name starts with a; <code>select(df, ends_with(&quot;z&quot;))</code> selects all columns whose name ends with z.</p></li>
<li><p><code>select(df, where(is.numeric))</code> selects all numeric columns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see more details in <code>?tidyr_tidy_select</code>.</p>
<div id="indirection" class="section level3">
<h3>Indirection</h3>
<p>Tidy selection makes a common task easier at the cost of making a less common task harder. When you want to use tidy select indirectly with the column specification stored in an intermediate variable, youll need to learn some new tools. There are three main cases where this comes up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you have the tidy-select specification in a function argument, you must <strong>embrace</strong> the argument by surrounding it in doubled braces.</p>

## Introduction

Rectangling is the art and craft of taking a deeply nested list (often sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data set of rows and columns. There are three functions from tidyr that are particularly useful for rectangling:

* `unnest_longer()` takes each element of a list-column and makes a new row.
* `unnest_wider()` takes each element of a list-column and makes a new column.
* `unnest_auto()` guesses whether you want `unnest_longer()` or `unnest_wider()`.
* `hoist()` is similar to `unnest_wider()` but only plucks out selected
  components, and can reach down multiple levels.
  
A very large number of data rectangling problems can be solved by combining these functions with a splash of dplyr (largely eliminating prior approaches that combined `mutate()` with multiple `purrr::map()`s). 

To illustrate these techniques, we'll use the repurrrsive package, which provides a number deeply nested lists originally mostly captured from web APIs.
  
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(repurrrsive)
```

## GitHub users

We'll start with `gh_users`, a list which contains information about six GitHub users. To begin, we put the `gh_users` list into a data frame:

```{r}
users <- tibble(user = gh_users)
```

This seems a bit counter-intuitive: why is the first step in making a list simpler to make it more complicated? But a data frame has a big advantage: it bundles together multiple vectors so that everything is tracked together in a single object.

Each `user` is a named list, where each element represents a column.

```{r}
names(users$user[[1]])
```

There are two ways to turn the list components into columns. `unnest_wider()` takes every component and makes a new column:

```{r}
users %>% unnest_wider(user)
```

But in this case, there are many components and we don't need most of them so we can instead use `hoist()`. `hoist()` allows us to pull out selected components using the same syntax as `purrr::pluck()`:

```{r}
users %>% hoist(user, 
  followers = "followers", 
  login = "login", 
  url = "html_url"
)
```

`hoist()` removes the named components from the `user` list-column, so you can think of it as moving components out of the inner list into the top-level data frame. 

## GitHub repos

We start off `gh_repos` similarly, by putting it in a tibble:

```{r}
repos <- tibble(repo = gh_repos)
repos
```

This time the elements of `user` are a list of repositories that belong to that user. These are observations, so should become new rows, so we use `unnest_longer()` rather than `unnest_wider()`:

```{r}
repos <- repos %>% unnest_longer(repo)
repos
```

Then we can use `unnest_wider()` or `hoist()`:

```{r}
repos %>% hoist(repo, 
  login = c("owner", "login"), 
  name = "name",
  homepage = "homepage",
  watchers = "watchers_count"
)
```

Note the use of `c("owner", "login")`: this allows us to reach two levels deep inside of a list. An alternative approach would be to pull out just `owner` and then put each element of it in a column:

```{r}
repos %>% 
  hoist(repo, owner = "owner") %>% 
  unnest_wider(owner)
```

Instead of looking at the list and carefully thinking about whether it needs to become rows or columns, you can use `unnest_auto()`. It uses a handful of heuristics to figure out whether `unnest_longer()` or `unnest_wider()` is appropriate, and tells you about its reasoning.

```{r}
tibble(repo = gh_repos) %>% 
  unnest_auto(repo) %>% 
  unnest_auto(repo)
```

## Game of Thrones characters

`got_chars` has a similar structure to `gh_users`: it's a list of named lists, where each element of the inner list describes some attribute of a GoT character. We start in the same way, first by creating a data frame and then by unnesting each component into a column:

```{r}
chars <- tibble(char = got_chars)
chars

chars2 <- chars %>% unnest_wider(char)
chars2
```

This is more complex than `gh_users` because some component of `char` are themselves a list, giving us a collection of list-columns:

```{r}
chars2 %>% select_if(is.list)
```

What you do next will depend on the purposes of the analysis. Maybe you want a row for every book and TV series that the character appears in:

```{r}
chars2 %>% 
  select(name, books, tvSeries) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(books, tvSeries), names_to = "media", values_to = "value") %>% 
  unnest_longer(value)
```

Or maybe you want to build a table that lets you match title to name:

```{r}
chars2 %>% 
  select(name, title = titles) %>% 
  unnest_longer(title)
```

(Note that the empty titles (`""`) are due to an infelicity in the input `got_chars`: ideally people without titles would have a title vector of length 0, not a title vector of length 1 containing an empty string.)

Again, we could rewrite using `unnest_auto()`. This is convenient for exploration, but I wouldn't rely on it in the long term - `unnest_auto()` has the undesirable property that it will always succeed. That means if your data structure changes, `unnest_auto()` will continue to work, but might give very different output that causes cryptic failures from downstream functions.

```{r}
tibble(char = got_chars) %>% 
  unnest_auto(char) %>% 
  select(name, title = titles) %>% 
  unnest_auto(title)
```

## Geocoding with google

Next we'll tackle a more complex form of data that comes from Google's geocoding service. It's against the terms of service to cache this data, so I first write a very simple wrapper around the API. This relies on having an Google maps API key stored in an environment; if that's not available these code chunks won't be run.

```{r}
has_key <- !identical(Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"), "")
if (!has_key) {
  message("No Google Maps API key found; code chunks will not be run")
}

# https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding
geocode <- function(address, api_key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")) {
  url <- "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json"
  url <- paste0(url, "?address=", URLencode(address), "&key=", api_key)

  jsonlite::read_json(url)
}
```

The list that this function returns is quite complex:

```{r, eval = has_key}
houston <- geocode("Houston TX")
str(houston)
```

Fortunately, we can attack the problem step by step with tidyr functions. To make the problem a bit harder (!) and more realistic, I'll start by geocoding a few cities:

```{r, eval = has_key, cache = TRUE}
city <- c("Houston", "LA", "New York", "Chicago", "Springfield")
city_geo <- purrr::map(city, geocode)
```

I'll put these results in a tibble, next to the original city name:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc <- tibble(city = city, json = city_geo)
loc
```

The first level contains components `status` and `result`, which we can reveal with `unnest_wider()`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json)
```

Notice that `results` is a list of lists. Most of the cities have 1 element (representing a unique match from the geocoding API), but Springfield has two. We can pull these out into separate rows with `unnest_longer()`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results)
```

Now these all have the same components, as revealed by `unnest_wider()`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results) %>% 
  unnest_wider(results)
```

We can find the lat and lon coordinates by unnesting `geometry`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results) %>% 
  unnest_wider(results) %>% 
  unnest_wider(geometry)
```

And then location:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>%
  unnest_longer(results) %>%
  unnest_wider(results) %>%
  unnest_wider(geometry) %>%
  unnest_wider(location)
```

Again, `unnest_auto()` makes this simpler with the small risk of failing in unexpected ways if the input structure changes:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_auto(json) %>%
  unnest_auto(results) %>%
  unnest_auto(results) %>%
  unnest_auto(geometry) %>%
  unnest_auto(location)
```

We could also just look at the first address for each city:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>%
  hoist(results, first_result = 1) %>%
  unnest_wider(first_result) %>%
  unnest_wider(geometry) %>%
  unnest_wider(location)
```

Or use `hoist()` to dive deeply to get directly to `lat` and `lng`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  hoist(json,
    lat = list("results", 1, "geometry", "location", "lat"),
    lng = list("results", 1, "geometry", "location", "lng")
  )
```

## Sharla Gelfand's discography

We'll finish off with the most complex list, from [Sharla Gelfand's](https://sharla.party/post/discog-purrr/) discography. We'll start the usual way: putting the list into a single column data frame, and then widening so each component is a column. I also parse the `date_added` column into a real date-time[^readr].

[^readr]: I'd normally use `readr::parse_datetime()` or `lubridate::ymd_hms()`, but I can't here because it's a vignette and I don't want to add a dependency to tidyr just to simplify one example.

```{r}
discs <- tibble(disc = discog) %>% 
  unnest_wider(disc) %>% 
  mutate(date_added = as.POSIXct(strptime(date_added, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"))) 
discs
```

At this level, we see information about when each disc was added to Sharla's discography, not any information about the disc itself. To do that we need to widen the `basic_information` column:

```{r, error = TRUE}
discs %>% unnest_wider(basic_information)
```

Unfortunately that fails because there's an `id` column inside `basic_information`. We can quickly see what's going on by setting `names_repair = "unique"`:

```{r}
discs %>% unnest_wider(basic_information, names_repair = "unique")
```

The problem is that `basic_information` repeats the `id` column that's also stored at the top-level, so we can just drop that:

```{r}
discs %>% 
  select(!id) %>% 
  unnest_wider(basic_information)
```

Alternatively, we could use `hoist()`:

```{r}
discs %>% 
  hoist(basic_information,
    title = "title",
    year = "year",
    label = list("labels", 1, "name"),
    artist = list("artists", 1, "name")
  )
```

Here I quickly extract the name of the first label and artist by indexing deeply into the nested list. 

A more systematic approach would be to create separate tables for artist and label:

```{r}
discs %>% 
  hoist(basic_information, artist = "artists") %>% 
  select(disc_id = id, artist) %>% 
  unnest_longer(artist) %>% 
  unnest_wider(artist)

discs %>% 
  hoist(basic_information, format = "formats") %>% 
  select(disc_id = id, format) %>% 
  unnest_longer(format) %>% 
  unnest_wider(format) %>% 
  unnest_longer(descriptions)
```

Then you could join these back on to the original dataset as needed.

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Pivoting</h1>



<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This vignette describes the use of the new <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> functions. Their goal is to improve the usability of <code>gather()</code> and <code>spread()</code>, and incorporate state-of-the-art features found in other packages.</p>
<p>For some time, its been obvious that there is something fundamentally wrong with the design of <code>spread()</code> and <code>gather()</code>. Many people dont find the names intuitive and find it hard to remember which direction corresponds to spreading and which to gathering. It also seems surprisingly hard to remember the arguments to these functions, meaning that many people (including me!) have to consult the documentation every time.</p>
<p>There are two important new features inspired by other R packages that have been advancing reshaping in R:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>pivot_longer()</code> can work with multiple value variables that may have different types, inspired by the enhanced <code>melt()</code> and <code>dcast()</code> functions provided by the <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki">data.table</a> package by Matt Dowle and Arun Srinivasan.</p></li>
<li><p><code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> can take a data frame that specifies precisely how metadata stored in column names becomes data variables (and vice versa), inspired by the <a href="https://winvector.github.io/cdata/">cdata</a> package by John Mount and Nina Zumel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this vignette, youll learn the key ideas behind <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> as you see them used to solve a variety of data reshaping challenges ranging from simple to complex.</p>
<p>To begin well load some needed packages. In real analysis code, Id imagine youd do with the <code>library(tidyverse)</code>, but I cant do that here since this vignette is embedded in a package.</p>

<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(dplyr)</span>

</div>
<div id="longer" class="section level2">
<h2>Longer</h2>
<p><code>pivot_longer()</code> makes datasets <strong>longer</strong> by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. I dont believe it makes sense to describe a dataset as being in long form. Length is a relative term, and you can only say (e.g.) that dataset A is longer than dataset B.</p>
<p><code>pivot_longer()</code> is commonly needed to tidy wild-caught datasets as they often optimise for ease of data entry or ease of comparison rather than ease of analysis. The following sections show how to use <code>pivot_longer()</code> for a wide range of realistic datasets.</p>
<div id="pew" class="section level3">
<h3>String data in column names</h3>
<p>The <code>relig_income</code> dataset stores counts based on a survey which (among other things) asked people about their religion and annual income:</p>

<p>We can start with the same basic specification as for the <code>relig_income</code> dataset. Here we want the names to become a variable called <code>week</code>, and the values to become a variable called <code>rank</code>. I also use <code>values_drop_na</code> to drop rows that correspond to missing values. Not every song stays in the charts for all 76 weeks, so the structure of the input data force the creation of unnecessary explicit <code>NA</code>s.</p>

<p>It would be nice to easily determine how long each song stayed in the charts, but to do that, well need to convert the <code>week</code> variable to an integer. We can do that by using two additional arguments: <code>names_prefix</code> strips off the <code>wk</code> prefix, and <code>names_transform</code> converts <code>week</code> into an integer:</p>

<p><code>country</code>, <code>iso2</code>, <code>iso3</code>, and <code>year</code> are already variables, so they can be left as is. But the columns from <code>new_sp_m014</code> to <code>newrel_f65</code> encode four variables in their names:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>new_</code>/<code>new</code> prefix indicates these are counts of new cases. This dataset only contains new cases, so well ignore it here because its constant.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sp</code>/<code>rel</code>/<code>ep</code> describe how the case was diagnosed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>m</code>/<code>f</code> gives the gender.</p></li>
<li><p><code>014</code>/<code>1524</code>/<code>2535</code>/<code>3544</code>/<code>4554</code>/<code>65</code> supplies the age range.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can break these variables up by specifying multiple column names in <code>names_to</code>, and then either providing <code>names_sep</code> or <code>names_pattern</code>. Here <code>names_pattern</code> is the most natural fit. It has a similar interface to <code>extract</code>: you give it a regular expression containing groups (defined by <code>()</code>) and it puts each group in a column.</p>

<p>We could go one step further use readr functions to convert the gender and age to factors. I think this is good practice when you have categorical variables with a known set of values.</p>

<h3>Multiple observations per row</h3>
<p>So far, we have been working with data frames that have one observation per row, but many important pivotting problems involve multiple observations per row. You can usually recognise this case because name of the column that you want to appear in the output is part of the column name in the input. In this section, youll learn how to pivot this sort of data.</p>

<p>Note that we have two pieces of information (or values) for each child: their <code>gender</code> and their <code>dob</code> (date of birth). These need to go into separate columns in the result. Again we supply multiple variables to <code>names_to</code>, using <code>names_sep</code> to split up each variable name. Note the special name <code>.value</code>: this tells <code>pivot_longer()</code> that that part of the column name specifies the value being measured (which will become a variable in the output).</p>

<h3>Duplicated column names</h3>
<p>Occassionally you will come across datasets that have duplicated column names. Generally, such datasets are hard to work with in R, because when you refer to a column by name it only finds the first match. To create a tibble with duplicated names, you have to explicitly opt out of the name repair that usually prevents you from creating such a dataset:</p>

<h2>Wider</h2>
<p><code>pivot_wider()</code> is the opposite of <code>pivot_longer()</code>: it makes a dataset <strong>wider</strong> by increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows. Its relatively rare to need <code>pivot_wider()</code> to make tidy data, but its often useful for creating summary tables for presentation, or data in a format needed by other tools.</p>

<p>The <code>fish_encounters</code> dataset, contributed by <a href="https://fishsciences.github.io/post/visualizing-fish-encounter-histories/">Myfanwy Johnston</a>, describes when fish swimming down a river are detected by automatic monitoring stations:</p>

<p>This dataset only records when a fish was detected by the station - it doesnt record when it wasnt detected (this is common with this type of data). That means the output data is filled with <code>NA</code>s. However, in this case we know that the absence of a record means that the fish was not <code>seen</code>, so we can ask <code>pivot_wider()</code> to fill these missing values in with zeros:</p>

<p>We get a warning that each cell in the output corresponds to multiple cells in the input. The default behaviour produces list-columns, which contain all the individual values. A more useful output would be summary statistics, e.g.<code>mean</code> breaks for each combination of wool and tension:</p>

<p>A related problem can occur when there are implicit missing factor levels or combinations in the <code>id_cols</code>. In this case, there are missing rows (rather than columns) that youd like to explicitly represent. For this example, well modify our <code>daily</code> data with a <code>type</code> column, and pivot on that instead, keeping <code>day</code> as an id column.</p>

<h3>Contact list</h3>
<p>A final challenge is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jienagu/tidyverse_examples/blob/master/example_long_wide.R">Jiena Gu</a>. Imagine you have a contact list that youve copied and pasted from a website:</p>

<p>This is challenging because theres no variable that identifies which observations belong together. We can fix this by noting that every contact starts with a name, so we can create a unique id by counting every time we see name as the <code>field</code>:</p>

<p>Here <code>SP.POP.GROW</code> is population growth, <code>SP.POP.TOTL</code> is total population, and <code>SP.URB.*</code> are the same but only for urban areas. Lets split this up into two variables: <code>area</code> (total or urban) and the actual variable (population or growth):</p>

<div id="multi-choice" class="section level3">
<h3>Multi-choice</h3>
<p>Based on a suggestion by <a href="https://github.com/MaximeWack">Maxime Wack</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/384" class="uri">https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/384</a>), the final example shows how to deal with a common way of recording multiple choice data. Often you will get such data as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb50"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb50-1"><a href="#cb50-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>multi <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">tribble</span>(</span>
<span id="cb50-2"><a href="#cb50-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="sc">~</span>id, <span class="sc">~</span>choice1, <span class="sc">~</span>choice2, <span class="sc">~</span>choice3,</span>
<span id="cb50-3"><a href="#cb50-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="st">&quot;A&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;B&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;C&quot;</span>,</span>
<span id="cb50-4"><a href="#cb50-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="st">&quot;C&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;B&quot;</span>,  <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span id="cb50-5"><a href="#cb50-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="st">&quot;D&quot;</span>,  <span class="cn">NA</span>,  <span class="cn">NA</span>,</span>
<span id="cb50-6"><a href="#cb50-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="st">&quot;B&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;D&quot;</span>,  <span class="cn">NA</span></span>
<span id="cb50-7"><a href="#cb50-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But the actual order isnt important, and youd prefer to have the individual questions in the columns. You can achieve the desired transformation in two steps. First, you make the data longer, eliminating the explicit <code>NA</code>s, and adding a column to indicate that this choice was chosen:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb51-1"><a href="#cb51-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>multi2 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> multi <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>

<span id="cb51-9"><a href="#cb51-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 2     1 choice2 B     TRUE   </span></span>
<span id="cb51-10"><a href="#cb51-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 3     1 choice3 C     TRUE   </span></span>

<h2>Manual specs</h2>
<p>The arguments to <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> allow you to pivot a wide range of datasets. But the creativity that people apply to their data structures is seemingly endless, so its quite possible that you will encounter a dataset that you cant immediately see how to reshape with <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code>. To gain more control over pivotting, you can instead create a spec data frame that describes exactly how data stored in the column names becomes variables (and vice versa). This section introduces you to the spec data structure, and show you how to use it when <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> are insufficient.</p>

<p>To see how this works, lets return to the simplest case of pivotting applied to the <code>relig_income</code> dataset. Now pivotting happens in two steps: we first create a spec object (using <code>build_longer_spec()</code>) then use that to describe the pivotting operation:</p>

<p>(This gives the same result as before, just with more code. Theres no need to use it here, it is presented as a simple example for using <code>spec</code>.)</p>
<p>What does <code>spec</code> look like? Its a data frame with one row for each column in the wide format version of the data that is not present in the long format, and two special columns that start with <code>.</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.name</code> gives the name of the column.</li>
<li><code>.value</code> gives the name of the column that the values in the cells will go into.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also one column in <code>spec</code> for each column present in the long format of the data that is not present in the wide format of the data. This corresponds to the <code>names_to</code> argument in <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>build_longer_spec()</code> and the <code>names_from</code> argument in <code>pivot_wider()</code> and <code>build_wider_spec()</code>. In this example, the income column is a character vector of the names of columns being pivoted.</p>

set.seed(1014)

# Manually "import"; only needed for old dplyr which uses old tidyselect
# which doesn't attach automatically in tidy-select contexts
all_of <- tidyselect::all_of
```

## Introduction

Most tidyr verbs use **tidy evaluation** to make interactive data exploration fast and fluid. Tidy evaluation is a special type of non-standard evaluation used throughout the tidyverse. Here's some typical tidyr code:

```{r}
library(tidyr)

iris %>%
  nest(data = !Species)
```

Tidy evaluation is why we can use `!Species` to say "all the columns except `Species`", without having to quote the column name (`"Species"`) or refer to the enclosing data frame (`iris$Species`).

Two basic forms of tidy evaluation are used in tidyr:

* **Tidy selection**: `drop_na()`, `fill()`, `pivot_longer()`/`pivot_wider()`,
  `nest()`/`unnest()`, `separate()`/`extract()`, and `unite()` let you select
  variables based on position, name, or type (e.g. `1:3`, `starts_with("x")`, or `is.numeric`). Literally, you can use all the same techniques as with
  `dplyr::select()`.

* **Data masking**: `expand()`, `crossing()` and `nesting()` let you refer to
  use data variables as if they were variables in the environment (i.e. you 
  write `my_variable` not `df$myvariable`). 
  
We focus on tidy selection here, since it's the most common. You can learn more about data masking in the equivalent vignette in dplyr: <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/programming.html>. For other considerations when writing tidyr code in packages, please see `vignette("in-packages")`.

We've pointed out that tidyr's tidy evaluation interface is optimized for interactive exploration. The flip side is that this adds some challenges to indirect use, i.e. when you're working inside a `for` loop or a function. This vignette shows you how to overcome those challenges. We'll first go over the basics of tidy selection and data masking, talk about how to use them indirectly, and then show you a number of recipes to solve common problems.

Before we go on, we reveal the version of tidyr we're using and make a small dataset to use in examples.

```{r}
packageVersion("tidyr")

mini_iris <- as_tibble(iris)[c(1, 2, 51, 52, 101, 102), ]
mini_iris
```

## Tidy selection

Underneath all functions that use tidy selection is the [tidyselect](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/) package. It provides a miniature domain specific language that makes it easy to select columns by name, position, or type. For example:

* `select(df, 1)` selects the first column; 
  `select(df, last_col())` selects the last column.
  
* `select(df, c(a, b, c))` selects columns `a`, `b`, and `c`.

* `select(df, starts_with("a"))` selects all columns whose name starts with "a";
  `select(df, ends_with("z"))` selects all columns whose name ends with "z".
  
* `select(df, where(is.numeric))` selects all numeric columns.

You can see more details in `?tidyr_tidy_select`.

### Indirection

Tidy selection makes a common task easier at the cost of making a less common task harder. When you want to use tidy select indirectly with the column specification stored in an intermediate variable, you'll need to learn some new tools. There are three main cases where this comes up:

*   When you have the tidy-select specification in a function argument, you 
    must **embrace** the argument by surrounding it in doubled braces.

    ```{r}
    nest_egg <- function(df, cols) {
      nest(df, egg = {{ cols }})
    }
    
    nest_egg(mini_iris, !Species)
    ```

*   When you have a character vector of variable names, you must use `all_of()` 
    or `any_of()` depending on whether you want the function to error if a 
    variable is not found. These functions allow you to write for loops or a
    function that takes variable names as a character vector.
    
    ```{r}
    nest_egg <- function(df, cols) {
      nest(df, egg = all_of(cols))
    }
    
    vars <- c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")
    nest_egg(mini_iris, vars)
    ```

*   In more complicated cases, you might want to use tidyselect directly:

    ```{r}
    sel_vars <- function(df, cols) {
      tidyselect::eval_select(rlang::enquo(cols), df)
    }
    sel_vars(mini_iris, !Species)
    ```
    
    Learn more in `vignette("tidyselect")`.
    
Note that many tidyr functions use `...` so you can easily select many variables, e.g. `fill(df, x, y, z)`. I now believe that the disadvantages of this approach outweigh the benefits, and that this interface would have been better as `fill(df, c(x, y, z))`. For new functions that select columns, please just use a single argument and not `...`.

  A nested data frame contains a list-column of data frames. It's an
  alternative way of representing grouped data, that works particularly well
  when you're modelling.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
```

## Basics

A nested data frame is a data frame where one (or more) columns is a list of data frames. You can create simple nested data frames by hand:

```{r}
df1 <- tibble(
  g = c(1, 2, 3),
  data = list(
    tibble(x = 1, y = 2),
    tibble(x = 4:5, y = 6:7),
    tibble(x = 10)
  )
)

df1
```

(It is possible to create list-columns in regular data frames, not just in tibbles, but it's considerably more work because the default behaviour of `data.frame()` is to treat lists as lists of columns.)

But more commonly you'll create them with `tidyr::nest()`:

```{r}
df2 <- tribble(
  ~g, ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,  2,
   2,  4,  6,
   2,  5,  7,
   3, 10,  NA
)
df2 %>% nest(data = c(x, y))
```

`nest()` specifies which variables should be nested inside; an alternative is to use `dplyr::group_by()` to describe which variables should be kept outside.

```{r}
df2 %>% group_by(g) %>% nest()
```

I think nesting is easiest to understand in connection to grouped data: each row in the output corresponds to one _group_ in the input. We'll see shortly this is particularly convenient when you have other per-group objects.

The opposite of `nest()` is `unnest()`. You give it the name of a list-column containing data frames, and it row-binds the data frames together, repeating the outer columns the right number of times to line up.

```{r}
df1 %>% unnest(data)
```

## Nested data and models

Nested data is a great fit for problems where you have one of _something_ for each group. A common place this arises is when you're fitting multiple models. 

```{r}
mtcars_nested <- mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  nest()

mtcars_nested
```

Once you have a list of data frames, it's very natural to produce a list of models:

```{r}
mtcars_nested <- mtcars_nested %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, function(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df)))
mtcars_nested
```

And then you could even produce a list of predictions:

```{r}
mtcars_nested <- mtcars_nested %>% 
  mutate(model = map(model, predict))
mtcars_nested  
```

This workflow works particularly well in conjunction with [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/), which makes it easy to turn models into tidy data frames which can then be `unnest()`ed to get back to flat data frames. You can see a bigger example in the [broom and dplyr vignette](https://broom.tidymodels.org/articles/broom_and_dplyr.html).

## Introduction

This vignette describes the use of the new `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions. Their goal is to improve the usability of `gather()` and `spread()`, and incorporate state-of-the-art features found in other packages.

For some time, it's been obvious that there is something fundamentally wrong with the design of `spread()` and `gather()`. Many people don't find the names intuitive and find it hard to remember which direction corresponds to spreading and which to gathering. It also seems surprisingly hard to remember the arguments to these functions, meaning that many people (including me!) have to consult the documentation every time.

There are two important new features inspired by other R packages that have been advancing reshaping in R:

* `pivot_longer()` can work with multiple value variables that may have 
  different types, inspired by the enhanced `melt()` and `dcast()` 
  functions provided by the [data.table][data.table] package by Matt Dowle 
  and Arun Srinivasan.

* `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` can take a data frame that specifies
  precisely how metadata stored in column names becomes data variables (and 
  vice versa), inspired by the [cdata][cdata] package by John Mount and 
  Nina Zumel. 

In this vignette, you'll learn the key ideas behind `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` as you see them used to solve a variety of data reshaping challenges ranging from simple to complex.

To begin we'll load some needed packages. In real analysis code, I'd imagine you'd do with the `library(tidyverse)`, but I can't do that here since this vignette is embedded in a package.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Longer

`pivot_longer()` makes datasets __longer__ by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. I don't believe it makes sense to describe a dataset as being in "long form". Length is a relative term, and you can only say (e.g.) that dataset A is longer than dataset B.

`pivot_longer()` is commonly needed to tidy wild-caught datasets as they often optimise for ease of data entry or ease of comparison rather than ease of analysis. The following sections show how to use `pivot_longer()` for a wide range of realistic datasets.

### String data in column names {#pew}

The `relig_income` dataset stores counts based on a survey which (among other things) asked people about their religion and annual income:

```{r}
relig_income
```

This dataset contains three variables:

* `religion`, stored in the rows,
* `income` spread across the column names, and 
* `count` stored in the cell values. 

To tidy it we use `pivot_longer()`:

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count")
```

* The first argument is the dataset to reshape, `relig_income`.

* The second argument describes which columns need to be reshaped. In this 
  case, it's every column apart from `religion`.

* The `names_to` gives the name of the variable that will be created from
  the data stored in the column names, i.e. `income`.
  
* The `values_to` gives the name of the variable that will be created from
  the data stored in the cell value, i.e. `count`.
  
Neither the `names_to` nor the `values_to` column exists in `relig_income`, so we provide them as character strings surrounded in quotes.

### Numeric data in column names {#billboard}

The `billboard` dataset records the billboard rank of songs in the year 2000. It has a form similar to the `relig_income` data, but the data encoded in the column names is really a number, not a string. 

```{r}
billboard
```

We can start with the same basic specification as for the `relig_income` dataset. Here we want the names to become a variable called `week`, and the values to become a variable called `rank`. I also use `values_drop_na` to drop rows that correspond to missing values. Not every song stays in the charts for all 76 weeks, so the structure of the input data force the creation of unnecessary explicit `NA`s.

```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```

It would be nice to easily determine how long each song stayed in the charts, but to do that, we'll need to convert the `week` variable to an integer. We can do that by using two additional arguments: `names_prefix` strips off the `wk` prefix, and `names_transform` converts `week` into an integer:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    names_prefix = "wk",
    names_transform = list(week = as.integer),
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE,
  )
```

Alternatively, you could do this with a single argument by using `readr::parse_number()` which automatically strips non-numeric components:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    names_transform = list(week = readr::parse_number),
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE,
  )
```

### Many variables in column names

A more challenging situation occurs when you have multiple variables crammed into the column names. For example, take the `who` dataset:

```{r}
who
```

`country`, `iso2`, `iso3`, and `year` are already variables, so they can be left as is. But the columns from `new_sp_m014` to `newrel_f65` encode four variables in their names:

* The `new_`/`new` prefix indicates these are counts of new cases. This
  dataset only contains new cases, so we'll ignore it here because it's 
  constant.
  
* `sp`/`rel`/`ep` describe how the case was diagnosed.

* `m`/`f` gives the gender.

* `014`/`1524`/`2535`/`3544`/`4554`/`65` supplies the age range.

We can break these variables up by specifying multiple column names in `names_to`, and then either providing `names_sep` or `names_pattern`. Here `names_pattern` is the most natural fit. It has a similar interface to `extract`: you give it a regular expression containing groups (defined by `()`) and it puts each group in a column.

```{r}
who %>% pivot_longer(
  cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65,
  names_to = c("diagnosis", "gender", "age"), 
  names_pattern = "new_?(.*)_(.)(.*)",
  values_to = "count"
)
```

We could go one step further use readr functions to convert the gender and age to factors. I think this is good practice when you have categorical variables with a known set of values.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
who %>% pivot_longer(
  cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65,
  names_to = c("diagnosis", "gender", "age"), 
  names_pattern = "new_?(.*)_(.)(.*)",
  names_transform = list(
    gender = ~ readr::parse_factor(.x, levels = c("f", "m")),
    age = ~ readr::parse_factor(
      .x,
      levels = c("014", "1524", "2534", "3544", "4554", "5564", "65"), 
      ordered = TRUE
    )
  ),
  values_to = "count",
)
```

### Multiple observations per row

So far, we have been working with data frames that have one observation per row, but many important pivotting problems involve multiple observations per row. You can usually recognise this case because name of the column that you want to appear in the output is part of the column name in the input. In this section, you'll learn how to pivot this sort of data. 

The following example is adapted from the [data.table vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table/vignettes/datatable-reshape.html), as inspiration for tidyr's solution to this problem.

```{r}
family <- tribble(
  ~family,  ~dob_child1,  ~dob_child2, ~gender_child1, ~gender_child2,
       1L, "1998-11-26", "2000-01-29",             1L,             2L,
       2L, "1996-06-22",           NA,             2L,             NA,
       3L, "2002-07-11", "2004-04-05",             2L,             2L,
       4L, "2004-10-10", "2009-08-27",             1L,             1L,
       5L, "2000-12-05", "2005-02-28",             2L,             1L,
)
family <- family %>% mutate_at(vars(starts_with("dob")), parse_date)
family
```

Note that we have two pieces of information (or values) for each child: their `gender` and their `dob` (date of birth). These need to go into separate columns in the result. Again we supply multiple variables to `names_to`, using `names_sep` to split up each variable name. Note the special name `.value`: this tells `pivot_longer()` that that part of the column name specifies the "value" being measured (which will become a variable in the output).

```{r}
family %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    !family, 
    names_to = c(".value", "child"), 
    names_sep = "_", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```

Note the use of `values_drop_na = TRUE`: the input shape forces the creation of explicit missing variables for observations that don't exist.

This problem also exists in the `anscombe` dataset built in to base R:

```{r}
anscombe
```

This dataset contains four pairs of variables (`x1` and `y1`, `x2` and `y2`, etc) that underlie Anscombe's quartet, a collection of four datasets that have the same summary statistics (mean, sd, correlation etc), but have quite different data. We want to produce a dataset with columns `set`, `x` and `y`.

```{r}
anscombe %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), 
    names_to = c(".value", "set"), 
    names_pattern = "(.)(.)"
  ) %>% 
  arrange(set)
```

A similar situation can arise with panel data. For example, take this example dataset provided by [Thomas Leeper](https://github.com/leeper/rio/issues/193). We can tidy it using the same approach as for `anscombe`:

```{r}
pnl <- tibble(
  x = 1:4,
  a = c(1, 1,0, 0),
  b = c(0, 1, 1, 1),
  y1 = rnorm(4),
  y2 = rnorm(4),
  z1 = rep(3, 4),
  z2 = rep(-2, 4),
)

pnl %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    !c(x, a, b), 
    names_to = c(".value", "time"), 
    names_pattern = "(.)(.)"
  )
```

### Duplicated column names

Occassionally you will come across datasets that have duplicated column names. Generally, such datasets are hard to work with in R, because when you refer to a column by name it only finds the first match. To create a tibble with duplicated names, you have to explicitly opt out of the name repair that usually prevents you from creating such a dataset:

```{r}
df <- tibble(id = 1:3, y = 4:6, y = 5:7, y = 7:9, .name_repair = "minimal")
df
```

When `pivot_longer()` encounters such data, it automatically adds another column to the output:

```{r}
df %>% pivot_longer(!id, names_to = "name", values_to = "value")
```

A similar process is applied when multiple input columns are mapped to the same output column, as in the following example where we ignore the numeric suffix on each column name:

```{r}
df <- tibble(id = 1:3, x1 = 4:6, x2 = 5:7, y1 = 7:9, y2 = 10:12)
df %>% pivot_longer(!id, names_to = ".value", names_pattern = "(.).")
```

## Wider

`pivot_wider()` is the opposite of `pivot_longer()`: it makes a dataset __wider__ by increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows. It's relatively rare to need `pivot_wider()` to make tidy data, but it's often useful for creating summary tables for presentation, or data in a format needed by other tools.

### Capture-recapture data

The `fish_encounters` dataset, contributed by [Myfanwy Johnston](https://fishsciences.github.io/post/visualizing-fish-encounter-histories/), describes when fish swimming down a river are detected by automatic monitoring stations:

```{r}
fish_encounters
```

Many tools used to analyse this data need it in a form where each station is a column:

```{r}
fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(names_from = station, values_from = seen)
```

This dataset only records when a fish was detected by the station - it doesn't record when it wasn't detected (this is common with this type of data). That means the output data is filled with `NA`s. However, in this case we know that the absence of a record means that the fish was not `seen`, so we can ask `pivot_wider()` to fill these missing values in with zeros:

```{r}
fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = station, 
  values_from = seen,
  values_fill = 0
)
```

### Aggregation

You can also use `pivot_wider()` to perform simple aggregation. For example, take the `warpbreaks` dataset built in to base R (converted to a tibble for the better print method):

```{r}
warpbreaks <- warpbreaks %>% as_tibble() %>% select(wool, tension, breaks)
warpbreaks
```

This is a designed experiment with nine replicates for every combination of `wool` (`A` and `B`) and `tension` (`L`, `M`, `H`):

```{r}
warpbreaks %>% count(wool, tension)
```

What happens if we attempt to pivot the levels of `wool` into the columns?

```{r}
warpbreaks %>% pivot_wider(names_from = wool, values_from = breaks)
```

We get a warning that each cell in the output corresponds to multiple cells in the input. The default behaviour produces list-columns, which contain all the individual values. A more useful output would be summary statistics, e.g. `mean` breaks for each combination of wool and tension:

```{r}
warpbreaks %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = wool, 
    values_from = breaks,
    values_fn = list(breaks = mean)
  )
```

For more complex summary operations, I recommend summarising before reshaping, but for simple cases it's often convenient to summarise within `pivot_wider()`.

### Generate column name from multiple variables

Imagine, as in <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24929954>, that we have information containing the combination of product, country, and year. In tidy form it might look like this:

```{r}
production <- expand_grid(
    product = c("A", "B"), 
    country = c("AI", "EI"), 
    year = 2000:2014
  ) %>%
  filter((product == "A" & country == "AI") | product == "B") %>% 
  mutate(production = rnorm(nrow(.)))
production
```

We want to widen the data so we have one column for each combination of `product` and `country`. The key is to specify multiple variables for `names_from`:

```{r}
production %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = c(product, country), 
  values_from = production
)
```

When either `names_from` or `values_from` select multiple variables, you can control how the column names in the output constructed with `names_sep` and `names_prefix`, or the workhorse `names_glue`:

```{r}
production %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = c(product, country), 
  values_from = production,
  names_sep = ".",
  names_prefix = "prod."
)

production %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = c(product, country), 
  values_from = production,
  names_glue = "prod_{product}_{country}"
)
```

### Tidy census

The `us_rent_income` dataset contains information about median income and rent for each state in the US for 2017 (from the American Community Survey, retrieved with the [tidycensus][tidycensus] package).

```{r}
us_rent_income
```

Here both `estimate` and `moe` are values columns, so we can supply them to `values_from`:

```{r}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = c(estimate, moe))
```

Note that the name of the variable is automatically appended to the output columns.

### Implicit missing values

Occasionally, you'll come across data where your names variable is encoded as a factor, but not all of the data will be represented.

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")

daily <- tibble(
  day = factor(c("Tue", "Thu", "Fri", "Mon"), levels = weekdays),
  value = c(2, 3, 1, 5)
)

daily
```

`pivot_wider()` defaults to generating columns from the values that are actually represented in the data, but you might want to include a column for each possible level in case the data changes in the future.

```{r}
pivot_wider(daily, names_from = day, values_from = value)
```

The `names_expand` argument will turn implicit factor levels into explicit ones, forcing them to be represented in the result. It also sorts the column names using the level order, which produces more intuitive results in this case.

```{r}
pivot_wider(daily, names_from = day, values_from = value, names_expand = TRUE)
```

If multiple `names_from` columns are provided, `names_expand` will generate a Cartesian product of all possible combinations of the `names_from` values. Notice that the following data has omitted some rows where the percentage value would be `0`. `names_expand` allows us to make those explicit during the pivot.

```{r}
percentages <- tibble(
  year = c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2020),
  type = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "B"), levels = c("A", "B")),
  percentage = c(100, 100, 40, 60)
)

percentages

pivot_wider(
  percentages,
  names_from = c(year, type),
  values_from = percentage,
  names_expand = TRUE,
  values_fill = 0
)
```

A related problem can occur when there are implicit missing factor levels or combinations in the `id_cols`. In this case, there are missing rows (rather than columns) that you'd like to explicitly represent. For this example, we'll modify our `daily` data with a `type` column, and pivot on that instead, keeping `day` as an id column.

```{r}
daily <- mutate(daily, type = factor(c("A", "B", "B", "A")))
daily
```

All of our `type` levels are represented in the columns, but we are missing some rows related to the unrepresented `day` factor levels.

```{r}
pivot_wider(
  daily, 
  names_from = type, 
  values_from = value,
  values_fill = 0
)
```

We can use `id_expand` in the same way that we used `names_expand`, which will expand out (and sort) the implicit missing rows in the `id_cols`.

```{r}
pivot_wider(
  daily, 
  names_from = type, 
  values_from = value,
  values_fill = 0,
  id_expand = TRUE
)
```

### Unused columns

Imagine you've found yourself in a situation where you have columns in your data that are completely unrelated to the pivoting process, but you'd still like to retain their information somehow. For example, in `updates` we'd like to pivot on the `system` column to create one row summaries of each county's system updates.

```{r}
updates <- tibble(
  county = c("Wake", "Wake", "Wake", "Guilford", "Guilford"),
  date = c(as.Date("2020-01-01") + 0:2, as.Date("2020-01-03") + 0:1),
  system = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "C"),
  value = c(3.2, 4, 5.5, 2, 1.2)
)

updates
```

We could do that with a typical `pivot_wider()` call, but we completely lose all information about the `date` column.

```{r}
pivot_wider(
  updates, 
  id_cols = county, 
  names_from = system, 
  values_from = value
)
```

For this example, we'd like to retain the most recent update date across all systems in a particular county. To accomplish that we can use the `unused_fn` argument, which allows us to summarize values from the columns not utilized in the pivoting process.

```{r}
pivot_wider(
  updates, 
  id_cols = county, 
  names_from = system, 
  values_from = value,
  unused_fn = list(date = max)
)
```

You can also retain the data but delay the aggregation entirely by using `list()` as the summary function.

```{r}
pivot_wider(
  updates, 
  id_cols = county, 
  names_from = system, 
  values_from = value,
  unused_fn = list(date = list)
)
```

### Contact list

A final challenge is inspired by [Jiena Gu](https://github.com/jienagu/tidyverse_examples/blob/master/example_long_wide.R). Imagine you have a contact list that you've copied and pasted from a website:

```{r}
contacts <- tribble(
  ~field, ~value,
  "name", "Jiena McLellan",
  "company", "Toyota", 
  "name", "John Smith", 
  "company", "google", 
  "email", "john@google.com",
  "name", "Huxley Ratcliffe"
)
```

This is challenging because there's no variable that identifies which observations belong together. We can fix this by noting that every contact starts with a name, so we can create a unique id by counting every time we see "name" as the `field`: 

```{r}
contacts <- contacts %>% 
  mutate(
    person_id = cumsum(field == "name")
  )
contacts
```

Now that we have a unique identifier for each person, we can pivot `field` and `value` into the columns:

```{r}
contacts %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = field, values_from = value)
```

## Longer, then wider

Some problems can't be solved by pivotting in a single direction. The examples in this section show how you might combine `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` to solve more complex problems.

### World bank

`world_bank_pop` contains data from the World Bank about population per country from 2000 to 2018.

```{r}
world_bank_pop
```

My goal is to produce a tidy dataset where each variable is in a column. It's not obvious exactly what steps are needed yet, but I'll start with the most obvious problem: year is spread across multiple columns.

```{r}
pop2 <- world_bank_pop %>% 
  pivot_longer(`2000`:`2017`, names_to = "year", values_to = "value")
pop2
```

Next we need to consider the `indicator` variable:

```{r}
pop2 %>% count(indicator)
```

Here `SP.POP.GROW` is population growth, `SP.POP.TOTL` is total population, and `SP.URB.*` are the same but only for urban areas. Let's split this up into two variables: `area` (total or urban) and the actual variable (population or growth): 

```{r}
pop3 <- pop2 %>% 
  separate(indicator, c(NA, "area", "variable"))
pop3
```

Now we can complete the tidying by pivoting `variable` and `value` to make `TOTL` and `GROW` columns:

```{r}
pop3 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value)
```

### Multi-choice

Based on a suggestion by [Maxime Wack](https://github.com/MaximeWack), <https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/384>), the final example shows how to deal with a common way of recording multiple choice data. Often you will get such data as follows:

```{r}
multi <- tribble(
  ~id, ~choice1, ~choice2, ~choice3,
  1, "A", "B", "C",
  2, "C", "B",  NA,
  3, "D",  NA,  NA,
  4, "B", "D",  NA
)
```

But the actual order isn't important, and you'd prefer to have the individual questions in the columns. You can achieve the desired transformation in two steps. First, you make the data longer, eliminating the explicit `NA`s, and adding a column to indicate that this choice was chosen:

```{r}
multi2 <- multi %>% 
  pivot_longer(!id, values_drop_na = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(checked = TRUE)
multi2
```

Then you make the data wider, filling in the missing observations with `FALSE`:

```{r}
multi2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = id,
    names_from = value, 
    values_from = checked, 
    values_fill = FALSE
  )
```

## Manual specs

The arguments to `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` allow you to pivot a wide range of datasets. But the creativity that people apply to their data structures is seemingly endless, so it's quite possible that you will encounter a dataset that you can't immediately see how to reshape with `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`. To gain more control over pivotting, you can instead create a "spec" data frame that describes exactly how data stored in the column names becomes variables (and vice versa). This section introduces you to the spec data structure, and show you how to use it when `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` are insufficient.

### Longer

To see how this works, lets return to the simplest case of pivotting applied to the `relig_income` dataset. Now pivotting happens in two steps: we first create a spec object (using `build_longer_spec()`) then use that to describe the pivotting operation:

```{r}
spec <- relig_income %>% build_longer_spec(
  cols = !religion, 
  names_to = "income",
  values_to = "count"
)
pivot_longer_spec(relig_income, spec)
```

(This gives the same result as before, just with more code. There's no need to use it here, it is presented as a simple example for using `spec`.)

What does `spec` look like?  It's a data frame with one row for each column in the wide format version of the data that is not present in the long format, and two special columns that start with `.`:

* `.name` gives the name of the column.
* `.value` gives the name of the column that the values in the cells will
  go into.

There is also one column in `spec` for each column present in the long format of the data that is not present in the wide format of the data. This corresponds to the `names_to` argument in `pivot_longer()` and `build_longer_spec()` and the `names_from` argument in `pivot_wider()` and `build_wider_spec()`. In this example, the income column is a character vector of the names of columns being pivoted.

```{r}
spec
```

### Wider

Below we widen `us_rent_income` with `pivot_wider()`. The result is ok, but I think it could be improved:

```{r}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = c(estimate, moe))
```

I think it would be better to have columns `income`, `rent`, `income_moe`, and `rent_moe`, which we can achieve with a manual spec. The current spec looks like this:

```{r}
spec1 <- us_rent_income %>% 
  build_wider_spec(names_from = variable, values_from = c(estimate, moe))
spec1
```

For this case, we mutate `spec` to carefully construct the column names:

```{r}
spec2 <- spec1 %>%
  mutate(.name = paste0(variable, ifelse(.value == "moe", "_moe", "")))
spec2
```

Supplying this spec to `pivot_wider()` gives us the result we're looking for:

```{r}
pivot_wider_spec(us_rent_income, spec2)
```

### By hand

Sometimes it's not possible (or not convenient) to compute the spec, and instead it's more convenient to construct the spec "by hand". For example, take this `construction` data, which is lightly modified from Table 5 "completions" found at <https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html>:

```{r}
construction
```

This sort of data is not uncommon from government agencies: the column names actually belong to different variables, and here we have summaries for number of units (1, 2-4, 5+) and regions of the country (NE, NW, midwest, S, W). We can most easily describe that with a tibble:

```{r}
spec <- tribble(
  ~.name,            ~.value, ~units,  ~region,     
  "1 unit",          "n",     "1",     NA,          
  "2 to 4 units",    "n",     "2-4",   NA,          
  "5 units or more", "n",     "5+",    NA,          
  "Northeast",       "n",     NA,      "Northeast", 
  "Midwest",         "n",     NA,      "Midwest",   
  "South",           "n",     NA,      "South",     
  "West",            "n",     NA,      "West",      
)
```

Which yields the following longer form:

```{r}
pivot_longer_spec(construction, spec)
```

Note that there is no overlap between the `units` and `region` variables; here the data would really be most naturally described in two independent tables.

### Theory

One neat property of the `spec` is that you need the same spec for `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`. This makes it very clear that the two operations are symmetric:

```{r}
construction %>% 
  pivot_longer_spec(spec) %>% 
  pivot_wider_spec(spec)
```

The pivotting spec allows us to be more precise about exactly how `pivot_longer(df, spec = spec)` changes the shape of `df`: it will have `nrow(df) * nrow(spec)` rows, and `ncol(df) - nrow(spec) + ncol(spec) - 2` columns.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This vignette serves two distinct, but related, purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It documents general best practices for using tidyr in a package, inspired by <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html">using ggplot2 in packages</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It describes migration patterns for the transition from tidyr v0.8.3 to v1.0.0. This release includes breaking changes to <code>nest()</code> and <code>unnest()</code> in order to increase consistency within tidyr and with the rest of the tidyverse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before we go on, well attach the packages we use, expose the version of tidyr, and make a small dataset to use in examples.</p>

<h2>Using tidyr in packages</h2>
<p>Here we assume that youre already familiar with using tidyr in functions, as described in <code>vignette(&quot;programming.Rmd)</code>. There are two important considerations when using tidyr in a package:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to avoid <code>R CMD CHECK</code> notes when using fixed variable names.</li>
<li>How to alert yourself to upcoming changes in the development version of tidyr.</li>
</ul>
<div id="fixed-column-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Fixed column names</h3>
<p>If you know the column names, this code works in the same way regardless of whether its inside or outside of a package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mini_iris <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">nest</span>(</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="at">petal =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(Petal.Length, Petal.Width), </span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="at">sepal =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; # A tibble: 3  3</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   Species    petal            sepal           </span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;           &lt;list&gt;          </span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 1 setosa     &lt;tibble [2  2]&gt; &lt;tibble [2  2]&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 2 versicolor &lt;tibble [2  2]&gt; &lt;tibble [2  2]&gt;</span></span>

<p>But <code>R CMD check</code> will warn about undefined global variables (<code>Petal.Length</code>, <code>Petal.Width</code>, <code>Sepal.Length</code>, and <code>Sepal.Width</code>), because it doesnt know that <code>nest()</code> is looking for the variables inside of <code>mini_iris</code> (i.e.<code>Petal.Length</code> and friends are data-variables, not env-variables).</p>
<p>The easiest way to silence this note is to use <code>all_of()</code>. <code>all_of()</code> is a tidyselect helper (like <code>starts_with()</code>, <code>ends_with()</code>, etc.) that takes column names stored as strings:</p>

<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span>

<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   Species    petal            sepal           </span></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;list&gt;           &lt;list&gt;          </span></span>

<p>Alternatively, you may want to use <code>any_of()</code> if it is OK that some of the specified variables cannot be found in the input data.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tidyselect.r-lib.org">tidyselect</a> package offers an entire family of select helpers. You are probably already familiar with them from using <code>dplyr::select()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="continuous-integration" class="section level3">
<h3>Continuous integration</h3>
<p>Hopefully youve already adopted continuous integration for your package, in which <code>R CMD check</code> (which includes your own tests) is run on a regular basis, e.g.every time you push changes to your packages source on GitHub or similar. The tidyverse team currently relies most heavily on GitHub Actions, so that will be our example. <code>usethis::use_github_action()</code> can help you get started.</p>
<p>We recommend adding a workflow that targets the devel version of tidyr. When should you do this?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always? If your package is tightly coupled to tidyr, consider leaving this in place all the time, so you know if changes in tidyr affect your package.</p></li>
<li><p>Right before a tidyr release? For everyone else, you could add (or re-activate an existing) tidyr-devel workflow during the period preceding a major tidyr release that has the potential for breaking changes, especially if youve been contacted during our reverse dependency checks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example of a GitHub Actions workflow that tests your package against the development version of tidyr:</p>

<div id="tidyr-v0.8.3---v1.0.0" class="section level2">
<h2>tidyr v0.8.3 -&gt; v1.0.0</h2>
<p>v1.0.0 makes considerable changes to the interface of <code>nest()</code> and <code>unnest()</code> in order to bring them in line with newer tidyverse conventions. I have tried to make the functions as backward compatible as possible and to give informative warning messages, but I could not cover 100% of use cases, so you may need to change your package code. This guide will help you do so with a minimum of pain.</p>
<p>Ideally, youll tweak your package so that it works with both tidyr 0.8.3 and tidyr 1.0.0. This makes life considerably easier because it means theres no need to coordinate CRAN submissions - you can submit your package that works with both tidyr versions, before I submit tidyr to CRAN. This section describes our recommend practices for doing so, drawing from the general principles described in <a href="https://principles.tidyverse.org/changes-multivers.html" class="uri">https://principles.tidyverse.org/changes-multivers.html</a>.</p>
<p>If you use continuous integration already, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend adding a build that tests with the development version of tidyr; see above for details.</p>
<p>This section briefly describes how to run different code for different versions of tidyr, then goes through the major changes that might require workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nest()</code> and <code>unnest()</code> get new interfaces.</li>
<li><code>nest()</code> preserves groups.</li>
<li><code>nest_()</code> and <code>unnest_()</code> are defunct.</li>
</ul>
<p>If youre struggling with a problem thats not described here, please reach out via <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/new">github</a> or <a href="mailto:hadley@rstudio.com">email</a> so we can help out.</p>
<div id="conditional-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Conditional code</h3>
<p>Sometimes youll be able to write code that works with v0.8.3 <em>and</em> v1.0.0. But this often requires code thats not particularly natural for either version and youd be better off to (temporarily) have separate code paths, each containing non-contrived code. You get to re-use your existing code in the old branch, which will eventually be phased out, and write clean, forward-looking code in the new branch.</p>
<p>The basic approach looks like this. First you define a function that returns <code>TRUE</code> for new versions of tidyr:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>tidyr_new_interface <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>() {</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">packageVersion</span>(<span class="st">&quot;tidyr&quot;</span>) <span class="sc">&gt;</span> <span class="st">&quot;0.8.99&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We highly recommend keeping this as a function because it provides an obvious place to jot any transition notes for your package, and it makes it easier to remove transitional code later on. Another benefit is that the tidyr version is determined at <em>run time</em>, not at <em>build time</em>, and will therefore detect your users current tidyr version.</p>
<p>Then in your functions, you use an <code>if</code> statement to call different code for different versions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>my_function_inside_a_package <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(...)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="co"># my code here</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="fu">tidyr_new_interface</span>()) {</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co"># Freshly written code for v1.0.0</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    out <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> tidyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">nest</span>(df, <span class="at">data =</span> <span class="fu">any_of</span>(<span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;x&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;y&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;z&quot;</span>)))</span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  } <span class="cf">else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co"># Existing code for v0.8.3</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    out <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> tidyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">nest</span>(df, x, y, z)</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="co"># more code here</span></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="er">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If your new code uses a function that only exists in tidyr 1.0.0, you will get a <code>NOTE</code> from <code>R CMD check</code>: this is one of the few notes that you can explain in your CRAN submission comments. Just mention that its for forward compatibility with tidyr 1.0.0, and CRAN will let your package through.</p>

<div id="new-syntax-for-nest" class="section level3">
<h3>New syntax for <code>nest()</code></h3>
<p>What changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The to-be-nested columns are no longer accepted as loose parts.</li>
<li>The new list-columns name is no longer provided via the <code>.key</code> argument.</li>
<li>Now we use a construct like this: <code>new_col = &lt;something about existing cols&gt;</code>.</li>

<p>Why it changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of <code>...</code> for metadata is a problematic pattern were moving away from. <a href="https://principles.tidyverse.org/dots-data.html" class="uri">https://principles.tidyverse.org/dots-data.html</a></p></li>

<h3><code>nest()</code> preserves groups</h3>
<p>What changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nest()</code> now preserves the groups present in the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>To reflect the growing support for grouped data frames, especially in recent releases of dplyr. See, for example, <code>dplyr::group_modify()</code>, <code>group_map()</code>, and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the fact that <code>nest()</code> now preserves groups is problematic downstream, you have a few choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Apply <code>ungroup()</code> to the result. This level of pragmatism suggests, however, you should at least consider the next two options.</p></li>
<li><p>You should never have grouped in the first place. Eliminate the <code>group_by()</code> call and specify which columns should be nested versus not nested directly in <code>nest()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust the downstream code to accommodate grouping.</p></li>

<p>This fails because <code>df</code> is grouped and <code>mutate()</code> is group-aware, so its hard to add a completely external variable.

<p>If, somehow, the grouping seems appropriate AND working inside the data frame is not an option, <code>tibble::add_column()</code> is group-unaware. It lets you add external data to a grouped data frame.</p>

## Data tidying

It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And it's not just a first step, but it must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. To get a handle on the problem, this paper focuses on a small, but important, aspect of data cleaning that I call data **tidying**: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. A standard makes initial data cleaning easier because you don't need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together. Current tools often require translation. You have to spend time munging the output from one tool so you can input it into another. Tidy datasets and tidy tools work hand in hand to make data analysis easier, allowing you to focus on the interesting domain problem, not on the uninteresting logistics of data.

## Defining tidy data {#defining}

> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
> --- Leo Tolstoy

Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning). In this section, I'll provide some standard vocabulary for describing the structure and semantics of a dataset, and then use those definitions to define tidy data.

### Data structure

Most statistical datasets are data frames made up of **rows** and **columns**. The columns are almost always labeled and the rows are sometimes labeled. The following code provides some data about an imaginary classroom in a format commonly seen in the wild. The table has three columns and four rows, and both rows and columns are labeled.

```{r}
classroom <- read.csv("classroom.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
classroom
```

There are many ways to structure the same underlying data. The following table shows the same data as above, but the rows and columns have been transposed.

```{r}
read.csv("classroom2.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The data is the same, but the layout is different. Our vocabulary of rows and columns is simply not rich enough to describe why the two tables represent the same data. In addition to appearance, we need a way to describe the underlying semantics, or meaning, of the values displayed in the table.

### Data semantics

A dataset is a collection of **values**, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a **variable** and an **observation**. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.

A tidy version of the classroom data looks like this: (you'll learn how the functions work a little later)

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
classroom2 <- classroom %>% 
  pivot_longer(quiz1:test1, names_to = "assessment", values_to = "grade") %>% 
  arrange(name, assessment)
classroom2
```

This makes the values, variables, and observations more clear. The dataset contains 36 values representing three variables and 12 observations. The variables are:

1. `name`, with four possible values (Billy, Suzy, Lionel, and Jenny).

2. `assessment`, with three possible values (quiz1, quiz2, and test1).

3. `grade`, with five or six values depending on how you think of the missing value (`r sort(unique(classroom2$grade), na.last = TRUE)`).

The tidy data frame explicitly tells us the definition of an observation. In this classroom, every combination of `name` and `assessment` is a single measured observation. The dataset also informs us of missing values, which can and do have meaning. Billy was absent for the first quiz, but tried to salvage his grade. Suzy failed the first quiz, so she decided to drop the class. To calculate Billy's final grade, we might replace this missing value with an F (or he might get a second chance to take the quiz). However, if we want to know the class average for Test 1, dropping Suzy's structural missing value would be more appropriate than imputing a new value.

For a given dataset, it's usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general. For example, if the columns in the classroom data were `height` and `weight` we would have been happy to call them variables. If the columns were `height` and `width`, it would be less clear cut, as we might think of height and width as values of a `dimension` variable. If the columns were `home phone` and `work phone`, we could treat these as two variables, but in a fraud detection environment we might want variables `phone number` and `number type` because the use of one phone number for multiple people might suggest fraud. A general rule of thumb is that it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., `z` is a linear combination of `x` and `y`, `density` is the ratio of `weight` to `volume`) than between rows, and it is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g., average of group a vs. average of group b) than between groups of columns.

In a given analysis, there may be multiple levels of observation. For example, in a trial of new allergy medication we might have three observational types: demographic data collected from each person (`age`, `sex`, `race`), medical data collected from each person on each day (`number of sneezes`, `redness of eyes`), and meteorological data collected on each day (`temperature`, `pollen count`).

Variables may change over the course of analysis. Often the variables in the raw data are very fine grained, and may add extra modelling complexity for little explanatory gain. For example, many surveys ask variations on the same question to better get at an underlying trait. In early stages of analysis, variables correspond to questions. In later stages, you change focus to traits, computed by averaging together multiple questions. This considerably simplifies analysis because you don't need a hierarchical model, and you can often pretend that the data is continuous, not discrete.

### Tidy data

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In **tidy data**:

1.  Every column is a variable.

2.  Every row is an observation.

3.  Every cell is a single value.

This is Codd's 3rd normal form, but with the constraints framed in statistical language, and the focus put on a single dataset rather than the many connected datasets common in relational databases. **Messy data** is any other arrangement of the data.

Tidy data makes it easy for an analyst or a computer to extract needed variables because it provides a standard way of structuring a dataset. Compare the different versions of the classroom data: in the messy version you need to use different strategies to extract different variables. This slows analysis and invites errors. If you consider how many data analysis operations involve all of the values in a variable (every aggregation function), you can see how important it is to extract these values in a simple, standard way. Tidy data is particularly well suited for vectorised programming languages like R, because the layout ensures that values of different variables from the same observation are always paired.

While the order of variables and observations does not affect analysis, a good ordering makes it easier to scan the raw values. One way of organising variables is by their role in the analysis: are values fixed by the design of the data collection, or are they measured during the course of the experiment? Fixed variables describe the experimental design and are known in advance. Computer scientists often call fixed variables dimensions, and statisticians usually denote them with subscripts on random variables. Measured variables are what we actually measure in the study. Fixed variables should come first, followed by measured variables, each ordered so that related variables are contiguous. Rows can then be ordered by the first variable, breaking ties with the second and subsequent (fixed) variables. This is the convention adopted by all tabular displays in this paper.

## Tidying messy datasets {#tidying}

Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three precepts of tidy data in almost every way imaginable. While occasionally you do get a dataset that you can start analysing immediately, this is the exception, not the rule. This section describes the five most common problems with messy datasets, along with their remedies:

-   Column headers are values, not variable names.

-   Multiple variables are stored in one column.

-   Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

-   Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

-   A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

Surprisingly, most messy datasets, including types of messiness not explicitly described above, can be tidied with a small set of tools: pivoting (longer and wider) and separating. The following sections illustrate each problem with a real dataset that I have encountered, and show how to tidy them.

### Column headers are values, not variable names

A common type of messy dataset is tabular data designed for presentation, where variables form both the rows and columns, and column headers are values, not variable names. While I would call this arrangement messy, in some cases it can be extremely useful. It provides efficient storage for completely crossed designs, and it can lead to extremely efficient computation if desired operations can be expressed as matrix operations. 

The following code shows a subset of a typical dataset of this form. This dataset explores the relationship between income and religion in the US. It comes from a report produced by the Pew Research Center, an American think-tank that collects data on attitudes to topics ranging from religion to the internet, and produces many reports that contain datasets in this format.

```{r}
relig_income
```

This dataset has three variables, `religion`, `income` and `frequency`. To tidy it, we need to **pivot** the non-variable columns into a two-column key-value pair. This action is often described as making a wide dataset longer (or taller). 

When pivoting variables, we need to provide the name of the new key-value columns to create. After defining the colums to pivot (every column except for religion), you will need the name of the key column, which is the name of the variable defined by the values of the column headings. In this case, it's `income`. The second argument is the name of the value column, `frequency`. 

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "frequency")
```

This form is tidy because each column represents a variable and each row represents an observation, in this case a demographic unit corresponding to a combination of `religion` and `income`.

This format is also used to record regularly spaced observations over time. For example, the Billboard dataset shown below records the date a song first entered the billboard top 100. It has variables for `artist`, `track`, `date.entered`, `rank` and `week`. The rank in each week after it enters the top 100 is recorded in 75 columns, `wk1` to `wk75`. This form of storage is not tidy, but it is useful for data entry. It reduces duplication since otherwise each song in each week would need its own row, and song metadata like title and artist would need to be repeated. This will be discussed in more depth in [multiple types](#multiple-types).

```{r}
billboard
```

To tidy this dataset, we first use `pivot_longer()` to make the dataset longer. We transform the columns from `wk1` to `wk76`, making a new column for their names, `week`, and a new value for their values, `rank`:

```{r}
billboard2 <- billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    wk1:wk76, 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
billboard2
```

Here we use `values_drop_na = TRUE` to drop any missing values from the rank column. In this data, missing values represent weeks that the song wasn't in the charts, so can be safely dropped.

In this case it's also nice to do a little cleaning, converting the week variable to a number, and figuring out the date corresponding to each week on the charts:

```{r}
billboard3 <- billboard2 %>%
  mutate(
    week = as.integer(gsub("wk", "", week)),
    date = as.Date(date.entered) + 7 * (week - 1),
    date.entered = NULL
  )
billboard3
```

Finally, it's always a good idea to sort the data. We could do it by artist, track and week:

```{r}
billboard3 %>% arrange(artist, track, week)
```

Or by date and rank:

```{r}
billboard3 %>% arrange(date, rank)
```

### Multiple variables stored in one column

After pivoting columns, the key column is sometimes a combination of multiple underlying variable names. This happens in the `tb` (tuberculosis) dataset, shown below. This dataset comes from the World Health Organisation, and records the counts of confirmed tuberculosis cases by `country`, `year`, and demographic group. The demographic groups are broken down by `sex` (m, f) and `age` (0-14, 15-25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, unknown).

```{r}
tb <- as_tibble(read.csv("tb.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
tb
```

First we use `pivot_longer()` to gather up the non-variable columns:

```{r}
tb2 <- tb %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    !c(iso2, year), 
    names_to = "demo", 
    values_to = "n", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
tb2
```

Column headers in this format are often separated by a non-alphanumeric character (e.g. `.`, `-`, `_`, `:`), or have a fixed width format, like in this dataset. `separate()` makes it easy to split a compound variables into individual variables. You can either pass it a regular expression to split on (the default is to split on non-alphanumeric columns), or a vector of character positions. In this case we want to split after the first character:

```{r}
tb3 <- tb2 %>% 
  separate(demo, c("sex", "age"), 1)
tb3
```

Storing the values in this form resolves a problem in the original data. We want to compare rates, not counts, which means we need to know the population. In the original format, there is no easy way to add a population variable. It has to be stored in a separate table, which makes it hard to correctly match populations to counts. In tidy form, adding variables for population and rate is easy because they're just additional columns.

In this case, we could also do the transformation in a single step by supplying multiple column names to `names_to` and also supplying a grouped regular expression to `names_pattern`:

```{r}
tb %>% pivot_longer(
  !c(iso2, year), 
  names_to = c("sex", "age"), 
  names_pattern = "(.)(.+)",
  values_to = "n", 
  values_drop_na = TRUE
)

```


### Variables are stored in both rows and columns

The most complicated form of messy data occurs when variables are stored in both rows and columns. The code below loads daily weather data from the Global Historical Climatology Network for one weather station (MX17004) in Mexico for five months in 2010. 

```{r}
weather <- as_tibble(read.csv("weather.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
weather
```

It has variables in individual columns (`id`, `year`, `month`), spread across columns (`day`, d1-d31) and across rows (`tmin`, `tmax`) (minimum and maximum temperature). Months with fewer than 31 days have structural missing values for the last day(s) of the month.

To tidy this dataset we first use pivot_longer to gather the day columns:

```{r}
weather2 <- weather %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    d1:d31, 
    names_to = "day", 
    values_to = "value", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) 
weather2
```

For presentation, I've dropped the missing values, making them implicit rather than explicit. This is ok because we know how many days are in each month and can easily reconstruct the explicit missing values.

We'll also do a little cleaning:

```{r}
weather3 <- weather2 %>% 
  mutate(day = as.integer(gsub("d", "", day))) %>%
  select(id, year, month, day, element, value)
weather3
```

This dataset is mostly tidy, but the `element` column is not a variable; it stores the names of variables. (Not shown in this example are the other meteorological variables `prcp` (precipitation) and `snow` (snowfall)). Fixing this requires widening the data: `pivot_wider()` is inverse of `pivot_longer()`, pivoting `element` and `value` back out across multiple columns:

```{r}
weather3 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = element, values_from = value)
```

This form is tidy: there's one variable in each column, and each row represents one day.

### Multiple types in one table {#multiple-types}

Datasets often involve values collected at multiple levels, on different types of observational units. During tidying, each type of observational unit should be stored in its own table. This is closely related to the idea of database normalisation, where each fact is expressed in only one place. It's important because otherwise inconsistencies can arise.

The billboard dataset actually contains observations on two types of observational units: the song and its rank in each week. This manifests itself through the duplication of facts about the song: `artist` is repeated many times. 

This dataset needs to be broken down into two pieces: a song dataset which stores `artist` and `song name`, and a ranking dataset which gives the `rank` of the `song` in each `week`.  We first extract a `song` dataset:

```{r}
song <- billboard3 %>% 
  distinct(artist, track) %>%
  mutate(song_id = row_number())
song
```  

Then use that to make a `rank` dataset by replacing repeated song facts with a pointer to song details (a unique song id):

```{r}
rank <- billboard3 %>%
  left_join(song, c("artist", "track")) %>%
  select(song_id, date, week, rank)
rank
```

You could also imagine a `week` dataset which would record background information about the week, maybe the total number of songs sold or similar "demographic" information.

Normalisation is useful for tidying and eliminating inconsistencies. However, there are few data analysis tools that work directly with relational data, so analysis usually also requires denormalisation or the merging the datasets back into one table.

### One type in multiple tables

It's also common to find data values about a single type of observational unit spread out over multiple tables or files. These tables and files are often split up by another variable, so that each represents a single year, person, or location. As long as the format for individual records is consistent, this is an easy problem to fix:

1.  Read the files into a list of tables.

2.  For each table, add a new column that records the original file name 
    (the file name is often the value of an important variable).

3.  Combine all tables into a single table.

Purrr makes this straightforward in R. The following code generates a vector of file names in a directory (`data/`) which match a regular expression (ends in `.csv`). Next we name each element of the vector with the name of the file. We do this because will preserve the names in the following step, ensuring that each row in the final data frame is labeled with its source. Finally, `map_dfr()` loops over each path, reading in the csv file and combining the results into a single data frame.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(purrr)
paths <- dir("data", pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
names(paths) <- basename(paths)
map_dfr(paths, read.csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, .id = "filename")
```

Once you have a single table, you can perform additional tidying as needed. An example of this type of cleaning can be found at <https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names> which takes 129 yearly baby name tables provided by the US Social Security Administration and combines them into a single file.

A more complicated situation occurs when the dataset structure changes over time. For example, the datasets may contain different variables, the same variables with different names, different file formats, or different conventions for missing values. This may require you to tidy each file to individually (or, if you're lucky, in small groups) and then combine them once tidied. An example of this type of tidying is illustrated in <https://github.com/hadley/data-fuel-economy>, which shows the tidying of <span>epa</span> fuel economy data for over 50,000 cars from 1978 to 2008. The raw data is available online, but each year is stored in a separate file and there are four major formats with many minor variations, making tidying this dataset a considerable challenge.

## Introduction

This vignette serves two distinct, but related, purposes:

* It documents general best practices for using tidyr in a package, 
  inspired by [using ggplot2 in packages][ggplot2-packages].
  
* It describes migration patterns for the transition from tidyr v0.8.3 to 
  v1.0.0. This release includes breaking changes to `nest()` and `unnest()`
  in order to increase consistency within tidyr and with the rest of the
  tidyverse.

Before we go on, we'll attach the packages we use, expose the version of tidyr, and make a small dataset to use in examples.

```{r setup}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(purrr)

packageVersion("tidyr")

mini_iris <- as_tibble(iris)[c(1, 2, 51, 52, 101, 102), ]
mini_iris
```

## Using tidyr in packages

Here we assume that you're already familiar with using tidyr in functions, as described in `vignette("programming.Rmd)`. There are two important considerations when using tidyr in a package:

* How to avoid `R CMD CHECK` notes when using fixed variable names.
* How to alert yourself to upcoming changes in the development version of tidyr.

### Fixed column names

If you know the column names, this code works in the same way regardless of whether its inside or outside of a package:

```{r}
mini_iris %>% nest(
  petal = c(Petal.Length, Petal.Width), 
  sepal = c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
)
```

But `R CMD check` will warn about undefined global variables (`Petal.Length`, `Petal.Width`, `Sepal.Length`, and `Sepal.Width`), because it doesn't know that `nest()` is looking for the variables inside of `mini_iris` (i.e. `Petal.Length` and friends are data-variables, not env-variables).

The easiest way to silence this note is to use `all_of()`. `all_of()` is a tidyselect helper (like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, etc.) that takes column names stored as strings:

```{r}
mini_iris %>% nest(
  petal = all_of(c("Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")), 
  sepal = all_of(c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"))
)
```

Alternatively, you may want to use `any_of()` if it is OK that some of the specified variables cannot be found in the input data.

The [tidyselect](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org) package offers an entire family of select helpers. You are probably already familiar with them from using `dplyr::select()`.

### Continuous integration

Hopefully you've already adopted continuous integration for your package, in which `R CMD check` (which includes your own tests) is run on a regular basis, e.g. every time you push changes to your package's source on GitHub or similar. The tidyverse team currently relies most heavily on GitHub Actions, so that will be our example. `usethis::use_github_action()` can help you get started.

We recommend adding a workflow that targets the devel version of tidyr. When should you do this?

* Always? If your package is tightly coupled to tidyr, consider leaving this 
  in place all the time, so you know if changes in tidyr affect your package. 
  
* Right before a tidyr release? For everyone else, you could add (or 
  re-activate an existing) tidyr-devel workflow during the period preceding a
  major tidyr release that has the potential for breaking changes, especially if you've been contacted during our reverse dependency checks.

Example of a GitHub Actions workflow that tests your package against the development version of tidyr:

``` yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

name: R-CMD-check-tidyr-devel

jobs:
  R-CMD-check:
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          install.packages(c("remotes", "rcmdcheck"))
          remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
          remotes::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
        shell: Rscript {0}
      - name: Check
        run: rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = "--no-manual", error_on = "error")
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

GitHub Actions are an evolving landscape, so you can always mine the workflows for tidyr itself ([tidyverse/tidyr/.github/workflows](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/tree/main/.github/workflows)) or the main [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) repo for ideas.

## tidyr v0.8.3 -> v1.0.0

v1.0.0 makes considerable changes to the interface of `nest()` and `unnest()` in order to bring them in line with newer tidyverse conventions. I have tried to make the functions as backward compatible as possible and to give informative warning messages, but I could not cover 100% of use cases, so you may need to change your package code. This guide will help you do so with a minimum of pain.

Ideally, you'll tweak your package so that it works with both tidyr 0.8.3 and tidyr 1.0.0. This makes life considerably easier because it means there's no need to coordinate CRAN submissions - you can submit your package that works with both tidyr versions, before I submit tidyr to CRAN. This section describes our recommend practices for doing so, drawing from the general principles described in <https://principles.tidyverse.org/changes-multivers.html>.

If you use continuous integration already, we **strongly** recommend adding a build that tests with the development version of tidyr; see above for details.

This section briefly describes how to run different code for different versions of tidyr, then goes through the major changes that might require workarounds: 

* `nest()` and `unnest()` get new interfaces.
* `nest()` preserves groups.
* `nest_()` and `unnest_()` are defunct.

If you're struggling with a problem that's not described here, please reach out via [github](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/new) or [email](mailto:hadley@rstudio.com) so we can help out.

### Conditional code

Sometimes you'll be able to write code that works with v0.8.3 _and_ v1.0.0. But this often requires code that's not particularly natural for either version and you'd be better off to (temporarily) have separate code paths, each containing non-contrived code. You get to re-use your existing code in the "old" branch, which will eventually be phased out, and write clean, forward-looking code in the "new" branch.

The basic approach looks like this. First you define a function that returns `TRUE` for new versions of tidyr:

```{r}
tidyr_new_interface <- function() {
  packageVersion("tidyr") > "0.8.99"
}
```

We highly recommend keeping this as a function because it provides an obvious place to jot any transition notes for your package, and it makes it easier to remove transitional code later on. Another benefit is that the tidyr version is determined at *run time*, not at *build time*, and will therefore detect your user's current tidyr version.

Then in your functions, you use an `if` statement to call different code for different versions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_function_inside_a_package <- function(...)
  # my code here

  if (tidyr_new_interface()) {
    # Freshly written code for v1.0.0
    out <- tidyr::nest(df, data = any_of(c("x", "y", "z")))
  } else {
    # Existing code for v0.8.3
    out <- tidyr::nest(df, x, y, z)
  }

  # more code here
}
```

If your new code uses a function that only exists in tidyr 1.0.0, you will get a `NOTE` from `R CMD check`: this is one of the few notes that you can explain in your CRAN submission comments. Just mention that it's for forward compatibility with tidyr 1.0.0, and CRAN will let your package through.

### New syntax for `nest()`

What changed:

*   The to-be-nested columns are no longer accepted as "loose parts".
*   The new list-column's name is no longer provided via the `.key` argument.
*   Now we use a construct like this: `new_col = <something about existing cols>`.
  
Why it changed:

*   The use of `...` for metadata is a problematic pattern we're moving away from.
    <https://principles.tidyverse.org/dots-data.html>

*   The `new_col = <something about existing cols>` construct lets us create 
    multiple nested list-columns at once ("multi-nest").

    ```{r}
    mini_iris %>% 
      nest(petal = matches("Petal"), sepal = matches("Sepal")) 
    ```

Before and after examples:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# v0.8.3
mini_iris %>% 
  nest(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, .key = "my_data")

# v1.0.0
mini_iris %>% 
  nest(my_data = c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width))

# v1.0.0 avoiding R CMD check NOTE
mini_iris %>% 
  nest(my_data = any_of(c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")))

# or equivalently:
mini_iris %>% 
  nest(my_data = !any_of("Species"))
```

If you need a quick and dirty fix without having to think, just call `nest_legacy()` instead of `nest()`. It's the same as `nest()` in v0.8.3:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (tidyr_new_interface()) {
  out <- tidyr::nest_legacy(df, x, y, z)
} else {
  out <- tidyr::nest(df, x, y, z)
}
```

### New syntax for `unnest()`

What changed:

* The to-be-unnested columns must now be specified explicitly, instead of
  defaulting to all list-columns. This also deprecates `.drop` and `.preserve`.

* `.sep` has been deprecated and replaced with `names_sep`.

* `unnest()` uses the [emerging tidyverse standard][name-repair]
  to disambiguate duplicated names. Use `names_repair = tidyr_legacy` to 
  request the previous approach.

* `.id` has been deprecated because it can be easily replaced by creating the column
  of names prior to `unnest()`, e.g. with an upstream call to `mutate()`.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # v0.8.3
    df %>% unnest(x, .id = "id")
    
    # v1.0.0
    df %>% mutate(id = names(x)) %>% unnest(x))
    ```

Why it changed:

* The use of `...` for metadata is a problematic pattern we're moving away from.
  <https://principles.tidyverse.org/dots-data.html>
  
* The changes to details arguments relate to features rolling out
  across multiple packages in the tidyverse. For example, `ptype` exposes
  prototype support from the new [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org).
  `names_repair` specifies what to do about duplicated or non-syntactic names,
  consistent with tibble and readxl.

Before and after:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nested <- mini_iris %>% 
  nest(my_data = c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width))

# v0.8.3 automatically unnests list-cols
nested %>% unnest()

# v1.0.0 must be told which columns to unnest
nested %>% unnest(any_of("my_data"))
```

If you need a quick and dirty fix without having to think, just call `unnest_legacy()` instead of `unnest()`. It's the same as `unnest()` in v0.8.3:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (tidyr_new_interface()) {
  out <- tidyr::unnest_legacy(df)
} else {
  out <- tidyr::unnest(df)
}
```

### `nest()` preserves groups

What changed:

* `nest()` now preserves the groups present in the input.

Why it changed:

* To reflect the growing support for grouped data frames, especially in recent
  releases of dplyr. See, for example, `dplyr::group_modify()`, `group_map()`,
  and friends.

If the fact that `nest()` now preserves groups is problematic downstream, you have a few choices:

* Apply `ungroup()` to the result. This level of pragmatism suggests, 
  however, you should at least consider the next two options.
  
* You should never have grouped in the first place. Eliminate the 
  `group_by()` call and specify which columns should be nested versus not 
  nested directly in `nest()`.

* Adjust the downstream code to accommodate grouping.

Imagine we used `group_by()` then `nest()` on `mini_iris`, then we computed on the list-column *outside the data frame*.

```{r}
(df <- mini_iris %>% 
   group_by(Species) %>% 
   nest())
(external_variable <- map_int(df$data, nrow))
```

And now we try to add that back to the data *post hoc*:

```{r error = TRUE}
df %>% 
  mutate(n_rows = external_variable)
```

This fails because `df` is grouped and `mutate()` is group-aware, so it's hard to add a completely external variable. Other than pragmatically `ungroup()`ing, what can we do? One option is to work inside the data frame, i.e. bring the `map()` inside the `mutate()`, and design the problem away:

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(n_rows = map_int(data, nrow))
```

If, somehow, the grouping seems appropriate AND working inside the data frame is not an option, `tibble::add_column()` is group-unaware. It lets you add external data to a grouped data frame.

```{r}
df %>% 
  tibble::add_column(n_rows = external_variable)
```

### `nest_()` and `unnest_()` are defunct

What changed:

* `nest_()` and `unnest_()` no longer work

Why it changed:

* We are transitioning the whole tidyverse to the powerful tidy eval framework.
  Therefore, we are gradually removing all previous solutions:
  - Specialized standard evaluation versions of functions, e.g., `foo_()` as a
    complement to `foo()`.
  - The older lazyeval framework.
  
Before and after:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# v0.8.3
mini_iris %>% 
  nest_(
    key_col = "my_data",
    nest_cols = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")
  )

nested %>% unnest_(~ my_data)

# v1.0.0
mini_iris %>% 
  nest(my_data = any_of(c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")))

nested %>% unnest(any_of("my_data"))
```

<p>(It is possible to create list-columns in regular data frames, not just in tibbles, but its considerably more work because the default behaviour of <code>data.frame()</code> is to treat lists as lists of columns.)</p>
<p>But more commonly youll create them with <code>tidyr::nest()</code>:</p>

<p><code>nest()</code> specifies which variables should be nested inside; an alternative is to use <code>dplyr::group_by()</code> to describe which variables should be kept outside.</p>

<p>I think nesting is easiest to understand in connection to grouped data: each row in the output corresponds to one <em>group</em> in the input. Well see shortly this is particularly convenient when you have other per-group objects.</p>
<p>The opposite of <code>nest()</code> is <code>unnest()</code>. You give it the name of a list-column containing data frames, and it row-binds the data frames together, repeating the outer columns the right number of times to line up.</p>

<p>Nested data is a great fit for problems where you have one of <em>something</em> for each group. A common place this arises is when youre fitting multiple models.</p>

<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">mutate</span>(<span class="at">model =</span> <span class="fu">map</span>(data, <span class="cf">function</span>(df) <span class="fu">lm</span>(mpg <span class="sc">~</span> wt, <span class="at">data =</span> df)))</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars_nested</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; # A tibble: 3  3</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; # Groups:   cyl [3]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;     cyl data               model </span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;             &lt;list&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 1     6 &lt;tibble [7  10]&gt;  &lt;lm&gt;  </span></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 2     4 &lt;tibble [11  10]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;  </span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 3     8 &lt;tibble [14  10]&gt; &lt;lm&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you could even produce a list of predictions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars_nested <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> mtcars_nested <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">mutate</span>(<span class="at">model =</span> <span class="fu">map</span>(model, predict))</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>mtcars_nested  </span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; # A tibble: 3  3</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; # Groups:   cyl [3]</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;     cyl data               model     </span></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><a href="#cb8-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;             &lt;list&gt;    </span></span>
<span id="cb8-8"><a href="#cb8-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 1     6 &lt;tibble [7  10]&gt;  &lt;dbl [7]&gt; </span></span>
<span id="cb8-9"><a href="#cb8-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 2     4 &lt;tibble [11  10]&gt; &lt;dbl [11]&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-10"><a href="#cb8-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; 3     8 &lt;tibble [14  10]&gt; &lt;dbl [14]&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This workflow works particularly well in conjunction with <a href="https://broom.tidymodels.org/">broom</a>, which makes it easy to turn models into tidy data frames which can then be <code>unnest()</code>ed to get back to flat data frames. You can see a bigger example in the <a href="https://broom.tidymodels.org/articles/broom_and_dplyr.html">broom and dplyr vignette</a>.</p>
